User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Sure! I'll create a script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!". 

Let's save the script: 

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>                                                                                
Preview
print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: âœ… Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script `hello.py` has been created. You can run it using the following command:

```bash
python3 hello.py
```

This will print "Hello, world!" to the console. Let me know if you need anything else!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
