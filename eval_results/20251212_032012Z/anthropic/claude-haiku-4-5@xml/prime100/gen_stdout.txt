User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call the script to run it

I'll create a Python script with a function to check if a number is prime, then find the 100th prime number. Let me write this script.

I should use absolute paths since the instructions mention that relative paths can become invalid when the working directory changes. Let me first get the current working directory.

Good, I have the current working directory. Now I'll create the prime.py script in that directory. I'll write a script that finds the 100th prime number.

I'll use a simple approach:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Count primes until we reach the 100th one
3. Print the result
