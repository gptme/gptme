<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

Currently it has:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

I'll use the patch tool with conflict markers to make this change.
