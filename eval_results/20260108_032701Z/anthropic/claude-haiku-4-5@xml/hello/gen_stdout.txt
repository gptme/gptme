The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file.

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The task is complete. I should confirm it was done or offer to run it if they'd like to verify.

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
