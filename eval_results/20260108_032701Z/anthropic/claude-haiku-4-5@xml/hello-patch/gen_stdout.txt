Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple string replacement.

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
</think>        </think>

<use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</use>

Done! The print statement now outputs "Hello, human!"                                                                                [03:26:09] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
