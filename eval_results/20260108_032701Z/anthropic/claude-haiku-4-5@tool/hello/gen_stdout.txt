User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create hello.py with the appropriate content.

It seems there's a permission denied error when trying to write to /app/hello.py. Let me try using a relative path instead. Since the user said the working directory is /app, I should be able to use just "hello.py" as a relative path.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the content that prints "Hello, world!". You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:26:10] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
