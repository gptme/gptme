The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. I should use the patch tool to modify the file.

The current content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I'll use the patch tool with git conflict markers.

Done! I've modified hello.py to ask for the user's name and greet them with it. Now when you run it, it will prompt for input and print "Hello, <name>!"                                                                                [03:26:10] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 3k context | 0% cached
