It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from writing to the `/app` directory. You might need to adjust the permissions or run the script with elevated privileges. Alternatively, you can specify a different directory where you have write access. Would you like to try a different location?                                                                                [03:25:57] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 790 context | 0% cached
