It seems there was an issue with the patch format. Let me correct that for you. I'll make sure to apply the patch correctly this time. 

<tool-use>
<patch args="/app/hello.py">
<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Invalid patch: invalid patch, no `<<<<<<<

It seems there is a persistent issue with the patch format. Let me try a different approach to ensure the patch is applied correctly. I'll rewrite the file with the updated content. 

<tool-use>
<save filePath="/app/hello.py">
print("Hello, human!")
</save>
</tool-use>                                                                                [03:26:01] Session: $0.02 | 3 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
