The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. Let me create a patch that changes the string being printed.

The ORIGINAL section should have:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

The UPDATED section should have:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```
</think>        </think>
