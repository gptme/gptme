<think>       <think>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' using the input

Looking at the current content, it just prints "Hello, world!". I need to:
1. Use `input()` to ask for the user's name
2. Store it in a variable
3. Print the greeting with the name

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file.
