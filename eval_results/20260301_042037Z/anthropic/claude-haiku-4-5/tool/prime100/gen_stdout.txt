User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

Let me create a script that finds the 100th prime number. I'll use a simple prime checking algorithm.

First, I'll write the script, then run it.
