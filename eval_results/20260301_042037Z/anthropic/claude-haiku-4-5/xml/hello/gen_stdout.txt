User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file.
</think>        </think>

<function_calls>
<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been successfully saved. The user asked me to write a hello.py script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed it was saved to hello.py. I should let the user know it's done.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the script that prints "Hello, world!".                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
