User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a Python script `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll create a script with a function to check if a number is prime, then find the 100th prime and print it.

Let me write the script and then run it.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="prime.py">
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1
    return num

print(find_nth_prime(100))
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
Now I need to run the script to execute it.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<shell>
python prime.py
</shell>
</tool-use>
                                                                                541
System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
Great! The script ran successfully and printed `541`, which is the 100th prime number. The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script computed and printed the 100th prime number: **541**                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
