User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants to: 1) initialize a git repo, 2) write a main.py file, and 3) commit it. I can do steps 1 and 2 in parallel, then commit.
</think>        </think>

I'll initialize the git repo and write `main.py` at the same time, then commit.
