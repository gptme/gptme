It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from writing to the `/app` directory. You might need to adjust the permissions or choose a different directory where I can save the file. Alternatively, you can create the file manually with the following content:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

If you need further assistance, let me know!                                                                                [04:19:11] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 772 context | 0% cached
