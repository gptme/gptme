User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script that efficiently computes and prints the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
To solve this, I'll:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run

Great! Let me verify the script works correctly:

<tool-use>
<shell>
python prime.py
</shell>
</tool-use>

python prime.py                                                                 

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The script successfully found the 100th prime number, which is 541. 
The implementation uses an efficient approach:
- `is_prime()` checks primality by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number
- `find_nth_prime()` iteratively finds prime numbers until the nth prime is reached
- The `main()` function prints the result when the script is run directly
</thinking>           </thinking>

Would you like me to explain the algorithm or make any modifications to the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
