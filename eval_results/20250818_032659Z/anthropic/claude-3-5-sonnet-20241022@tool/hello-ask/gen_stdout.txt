I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.
The original code is a simple print statement, and we need to:
1. Add input() to get the user's name
2. Modify the print statement to use the name variable

I've modified the file to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Store it in a variable called 'name'
3. Use an f-string to print the personalized greeting with exactly the format you requested: 'Hello, <name>!'                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
