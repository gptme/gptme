User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll help you write a script to find the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
1. We need a function to check if a number is prime
2. We need to count prime numbers until we reach the 100th one
3. We'll use a simple but efficient approach:
   - Check divisibility up to square root of the number
   - Use early return for efficiency

Let's test the script to make sure it works correctly:

<tool-use>
<shell>
python3 prime.py
</shell>
</tool-use>
                                                                                
Preview
python3 prime.py                                                                

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script is working correctly! It found that 541 is the 100th prime number.

We can verify this is correct by checking against known prime number lists. 541 is indeed the 100th prime number.

The script is efficient for this purpose because it:
1. Only checks odd numbers after 2
2. Only tests divisors up to the square root
3. Returns early when a divisor is found

Would you like to make any modifications to the script or would you like to test it with a different nth prime number?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
