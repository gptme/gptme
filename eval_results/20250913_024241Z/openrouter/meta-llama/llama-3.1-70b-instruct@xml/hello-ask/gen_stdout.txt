<thinking>It seems like the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the file contents being different from what I expected. Let me try again by reading the file contents first.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<shell>
cat hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                print("Hello, world!")System:

<thinking>Now that I have the correct file contents, I can try to patch the file again.</thinking>
