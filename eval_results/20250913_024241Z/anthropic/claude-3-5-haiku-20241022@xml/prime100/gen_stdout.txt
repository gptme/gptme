User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll solve this step by step:

<thinking>          <thinking>
1. I'll write a Python script to find prime numbers
2. The script should:
   - Have a function to check if a number is prime
   - Generate prime numbers until the 100th is found
   - Print the 100th prime number
3. I'll use the save tool to create the script
4. Then use the shell tool to run it

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The script successfully found the 100th prime number, which is 541.

Let me break down how the script works:
1. `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
3. When run directly, it prints the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

The 100th prime number is 541. The script worked exactly as intended. Would you like me to explain the algorithm in more detail or demonstrate anything else with the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
