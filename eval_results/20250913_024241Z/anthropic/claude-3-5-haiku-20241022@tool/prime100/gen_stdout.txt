User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll help you write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll break this down into steps:
1. Write a function to check if a number is prime
2. Create a function to find the 100th prime number
3. Save the script to prime.py
4. Execute the script
</thinking>           </thinking>

@save: {
  "path": "prime.py",
  "content": """def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return num
        num += 1

def main():
    hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
"""
}

Now, I'll run the script:

@shell: {
  "command": "python prime.py"
}

The script does the following:
- `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
- `find_nth_prime()` finds the nth prime number by counting primes
- `main()` finds and prints the 100th prime number
- The `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensures the main function runs when the script is directly executed                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
