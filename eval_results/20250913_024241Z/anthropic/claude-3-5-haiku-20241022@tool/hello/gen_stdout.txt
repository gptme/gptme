I'll use the `save` tool to create the hello.py script.
@save(toolu_01AHT4viPVz3GuYX3vZvbsfj): {"path": "hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")"}

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I've created a simple Python script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!" when run. The script is now saved in the current directory (/tmp/gptme-evals-a_gdryb7). You can run it using Python to see the output.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
