User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
To solve this, I'll:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run

Let's verify the script works correctly by running it:

<tool-use>
<shell>python /tmp/gptme-evals-6_on3gx8/prime.py</shell>
</tool-use>

python /tmp/gptme-evals-6_on3gx8/prime.py                                       

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python /tmp/gptme-evals-6_on3gx8/prime.py`

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Great! Let me explain the script briefly:

1. `is_prime(n)` checks if a given number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root.
2. `find_nth_prime(n)` finds the nth prime number by incrementing through numbers and counting primes.
3. `main()` specifically finds the 100th prime number and prints it.

The script successfully computed that the 100th prime number is 541. 

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the implementation or demonstrate anything else with the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
