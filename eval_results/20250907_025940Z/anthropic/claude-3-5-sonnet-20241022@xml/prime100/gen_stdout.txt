User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll help you write a script to find the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
1. We need a function to check if a number is prime
2. We need to count prime numbers until we reach the 100th one
3. We'll use a simple but efficient approach by checking divisibility up to sqrt(n)

Let's test the script to make sure it works correctly:

<tool-use>
<shell>python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-81cqmoh8/prime.py</shell>
</tool-use>
                                                                                
Preview
python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-81cqmoh8/prime.py                                      

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-81cqmoh8/prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script is working correctly. It found that 541 is the 100th prime number. 

To verify this result:
<tool-use>
<shell>python3 -c "print(len([x for x in range(2, 542) if all(x % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1))]))"</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                
Preview
python3 -c "print(len([x for x in range(2, 542) if all(x % i != 0 for i in range

100
System: 
Ran command: `python3 -c "print(len())"`

`100`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Perfect! The verification confirms that our script is correct - there are exactly 100 prime numbers up to and including 541, making 541 the 100th prime number.

The script is complete and working as required. Is there anything else you'd like me to explain or modify about it?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
