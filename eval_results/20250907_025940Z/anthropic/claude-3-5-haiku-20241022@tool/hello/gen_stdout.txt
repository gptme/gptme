I'll use the `save` tool to create the `hello.py` script.
@save(toolu_014QsCD7r5TK2ejSpKhaBmqu): {"path": "hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")"}

I've created a simple Python script `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!" when executed. The script is now saved in the current directory (/tmp/gptme-evals-fudr740w). 

Would you like me to demonstrate running the script or make any modifications?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
