Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be because the file contents have changed since I last read it, or because the patch was not correctly applied. To resolve this, I will re-read the file and try to apply the patch again.</thinking>

Let me re-read the file and try again.

<tool-use>
<exec args='cat /tmp/gptme-evals-zqu2jvcq/hello.py'>
</exec>
</tool-use>

Please execute the above command so I can re-read the file.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
