The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". I need to use the patch tool to make this modification.

The current content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And it should be:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

I'll use the patch tool with the conflict marker format.
