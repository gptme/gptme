User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/execute the script

I'll create a Python script that finds prime numbers. I need an efficient way to find the 100th prime. A simple approach would be to check each number for primality until we've found 100 primes.

Let me write this script and then execute it.
