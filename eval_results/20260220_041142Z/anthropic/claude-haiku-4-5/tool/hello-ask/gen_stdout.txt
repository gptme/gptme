The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. 

I need to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print the greeting with their name

Let me use the patch tool to modify the file. The current content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
```
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Let me use the patch tool with git conflict markers.
