User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it

The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I should:
1. First check the current directory with pwd to know where I am
2. Initialize git with `git init`
3. Create a main.py file with some content using the save tool
4. Configure git (if needed) 
5. Add the file with `git add`
6. Commit it with `git commit`

Let me start by checking the current directory and then doing these steps.
