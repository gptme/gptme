User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Create a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll write a simple prime number calculator that finds the 100th prime number.

The approach:
- Create a function to check if a number is prime
- Keep checking numbers until we find 100 primes
- Print the 100th prime

Let me write and execute this.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="prime.py">
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
num = 2

while count < 100:
    if is_prime(num):
        count += 1
        if count == 100:
            print(f"The 100th prime number is: {num}")
            break
    num += 1
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
Now I need to run the script to show the output.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<shell>
python prime.py
</shell>
</tool-use>
                                                                                The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
Perfect! The script ran successfully and computed the 100th prime number, which is 541. The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! The 100th prime number is **541**.                                                                                [04:11:05] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
