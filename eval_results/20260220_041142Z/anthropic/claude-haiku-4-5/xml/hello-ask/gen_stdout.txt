The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

Looking at the current content:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to:
1. Add a line to ask for the user's name
2. Store the input
3. Print a greeting with that name

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.
