User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I should use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the appropriate Python code.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user's task is complete. I should let them know it's done and offer to run it if they'd like.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the script. You can run it with:
```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [04:11:01] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 965 context | 0% cached
