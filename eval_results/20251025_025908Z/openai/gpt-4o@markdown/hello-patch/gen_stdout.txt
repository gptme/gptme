Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py

````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", I'll create a patch for you. 

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

It seems there was an issue with applying the patch because the file `hello.py` could not be found. Let's first check the current working directory to ensure the file path is correct. Then, we can locate `hello.py` and apply the patch. 

Let's start by checking the current working directory. Can you please run the following command?

```bash
pwd
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
