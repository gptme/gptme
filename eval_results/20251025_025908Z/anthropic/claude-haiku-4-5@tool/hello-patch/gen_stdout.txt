Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I'll use the patch tool to make this change. I need to:
1. Find the exact line that needs to be changed
2. Replace it with the new text

The change is straightforward:
- ORIGINAL: print("Hello, world!")
- UPDATED: print("Hello, human!")
</thinking>           </thinking>
@patch(toolu_01WsrWmMbVHWjPYqE5tFsFRg): {"path": "hello.py", "patch": "<<<<<<< ORIGINAL\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n=======\nprint(\"Hello, human!\")\n>>>>>>> UPDATED"}
