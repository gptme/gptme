User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to create a script called hello.py that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I should use the save tool to create this file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

System: âœ… Saved to hello.py

The file has been saved successfully. The user's simple request has been completed. I should confirm this is done and perhaps offer to run it if they'd like to verify it works.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
