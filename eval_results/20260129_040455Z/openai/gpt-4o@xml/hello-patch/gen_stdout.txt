Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", I'll create a patch for you. 

<tool-use>
<patch args="/app/hello.py">
<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Invalid patch: invalid patch, no `<<<<<<< 
ORIGINAL`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems there was an issue with the patch format. Let me correct that for you. 

<tool-use>
<patch args="/app/hello.py">
<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Invalid patch: invalid patch, no `<<<<<<< 
ORIGINAL`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems there is a persistent issue with the patch format. Let me try a different approach to ensure the patch is applied correctly. 

<tool-use>
<patch args="/app/hello.py">
<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Invalid patch: invalid patch, no `<<<<<<< 
ORIGINAL`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems there is a consistent issue with the patch application. Let me try using a different method to update the file. I'll rewrite the entire file content instead. 

<tool-use>
<save filePath="/app/hello.py">
print("Hello, human!")
</save>
</tool-use>                                                                                [04:03:51] Session: $0.02 | 4 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
