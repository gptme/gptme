<think>       <think>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print "Hello, <name>!". I have the content of the file shown:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change this to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print a greeting with their name

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.
