The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I'll do this step by step:
1. First, check the current directory and initialize git
2. Create a main.py file
3. Add and commit it

Let me start by checking the current directory, then initialize git, create the file, and commit.
