The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'.

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file. The current content is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to ask for the user's name and print the greeting with their name. Here's what I need to do:
1. Use `input()` to ask for the user's name
2. Use an f-string to print the greeting with the name

Let me apply the patch:
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

+name = input("What is your name? ")

Done! The file has been modified. It now asks the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
