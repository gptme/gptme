The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I need to use the save tool to create a file called hello.py with the appropriate Python code.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")

<think>       <think>
The file has been successfully saved. The user's request is complete. I should confirm this is done.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created with the code to print "Hello, world!". You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
