Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

The patch needs to:
- Change `"Hello, world!"` to `"Hello, human!"`

Let me apply this patch using the conflict marker format.
