The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the file.

I got a permission denied error. Let me try with a relative path since the user said the working directory is /app. I'll just use "hello.py" as a relative path.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the script that prints "Hello, world!". You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:44:02] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
