<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of the current "Hello, world!".

I need to:
1. Use the patch tool to modify the file
2. Replace the print statement with code that asks for the user's name and then prints a greeting with that name

Let me use the patch tool to make this change.
