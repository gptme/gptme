Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple string replacement.

Let me use the patch tool to make this change.

<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")

print("Hello, human!")
