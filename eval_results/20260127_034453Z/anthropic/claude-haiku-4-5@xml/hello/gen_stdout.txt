The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

<think>       <think>
The file has been successfully saved. The user now has a hello.py script that prints "Hello, world!". I should confirm this is done and offer to help with anything else if needed.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:44:01] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 957 context | 0% cached
