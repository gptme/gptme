It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the current directory. Let's first check the contents of the current directory to see if the file is located elsewhere or if it needs to be created.

It seems there is an issue with locating the file `hello.py`. Let's create the file with the desired content.

It seems I am unable to create the file directly. Could you please create a file named `hello.py` in the `/app` directory with the following content?

```python
print("Hello, human!")
```

Once the file is created, let me know if you need further assistance!                                                                                [03:43:53] Session: $0.02 | 4 turns | 1k context | 69% cached
