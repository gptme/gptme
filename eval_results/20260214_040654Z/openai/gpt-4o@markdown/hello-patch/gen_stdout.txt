Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll create a patch for you. 

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Patch failed: No such file or directory

It seems there was an issue with applying the patch because the file `hello.py` could not be found. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to ensure that `hello.py` exists. 

I'll run the necessary commands to verify the file's presence.                                                                                [04:05:52] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
