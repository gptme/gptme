User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/execute that script

I'll create a script that finds the 100th prime number. A straightforward approach is to iterate through numbers, check if they're prime, and count until we reach 100.

Let me write a script that does this.
