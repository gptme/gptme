The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. I have the current content of the file, which is:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to modify it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' with the provided name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
