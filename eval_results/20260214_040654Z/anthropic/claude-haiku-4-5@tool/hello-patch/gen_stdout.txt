User: 
Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple string replacement.

I need to use the patch tool with:
- path: "hello.py"
- patch: a conflict marker format showing the original and updated content

The original line is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And it should be updated to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

Let me create the patch:
