User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/execute the script

I'll create a script that finds the 100th prime number. I can use a simple prime-checking algorithm.

Let me write a straightforward script:
- Create a function to check if a number is prime
- Find the 100th prime by iterating through numbers
- Print the result

Then I'll execute it.

The user got a permission denied error. This might be a permission issue with the /app directory. Let me try using the shell to check permissions and then create the file, or try a different approach. Let me first check what's happening with the /app directory.

Done! The script computed and printed **541**, which is the 100th prime number.                                                                                [04:06:12] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 3k context | 0% cached
