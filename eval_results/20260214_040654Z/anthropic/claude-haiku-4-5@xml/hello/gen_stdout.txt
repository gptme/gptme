<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll create a file called hello.py with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user's request is complete - I've written the hello.py script that prints "Hello, world!". I should let them know it's done and ready to run if they want to execute it.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` is ready. You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like to test it.                                                                                [04:06:04] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 960 context | 0% cached
