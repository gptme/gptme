<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of the current "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to make this change. Let me identify what needs to be changed:
- Current: `print("Hello, world!")`
- New: Ask for name input, then print with that name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

Done! I've updated hello.py to:
1. Ask the user for their name with `input()`
2. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
