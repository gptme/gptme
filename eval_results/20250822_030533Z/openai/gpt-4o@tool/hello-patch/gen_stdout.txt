It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the `/app` directory. Let's first check the current directory to ensure we're in the right place, and then list the files to see if `hello.py` is present. Could you please run the following commands?

```bash
pwd
ls /app
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
