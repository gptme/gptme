I've created the hello.py file with the requested functionality. The script will now:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

You can run it with `python hello.py` and it will prompt for your name and then greet you personally.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
