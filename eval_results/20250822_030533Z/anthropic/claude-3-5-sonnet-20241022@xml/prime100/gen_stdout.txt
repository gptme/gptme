User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll help you write a script to find the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
1. We need a function to check if a number is prime
2. We need to count prime numbers until we reach the 100th one
3. We'll use a simple but efficient approach by checking divisibility up to sqrt(n)

Let's test the script to make sure it works correctly:

<tool-use>
<shell>
python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-drq4qsqi/prime.py
</shell>
</tool-use>
                                                                                
Preview
python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-drq4qsqi/prime.py                                      

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-drq4qsqi/prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script has successfully computed that 541 is the 100th prime number. 

Let's verify this is correct by checking against a known list of prime numbers:

<tool-use>
<shell>
python3 -c "print([n for n in range(2, 1000) if all(n % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1))][:100][-1])"
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                
Preview
python3 -c "print([n for n in range(2, 1000) if all(n % i != 0 for i in range(2,

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 -c "print([:100][-1])"`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Perfect! Our script is working correctly. The 100th prime number is indeed 541, which has been verified by two different implementations.

The script is complete and accurate. Is there anything specific about it you'd like me to explain or modify?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
