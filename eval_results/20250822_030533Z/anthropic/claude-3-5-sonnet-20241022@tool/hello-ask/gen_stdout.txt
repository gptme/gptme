I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.
The file exists and contains a simple print statement that we need to modify.

I've modified the file to:
1. Ask for the user's name using `input()`
2. Store it in a variable called `name`
3. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

The program will now ask for the user's name and print "Hello, " followed by their name and an exclamation mark.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
