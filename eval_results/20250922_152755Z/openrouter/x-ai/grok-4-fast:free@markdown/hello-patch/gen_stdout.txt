The user wants to patch hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". Assuming hello.py is in the current working directory (/Users/erb/Programming/gptme), I'll apply a minimal patch replacing the string in the print statement. This scopes the change to just that line without affecting indentation or structure.

```patch hello.py

print("Hello, world!")

print("Hello, human!")
