User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'

<thinking>Let's use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file. We'll add a line to ask for the user's name and then print out a greeting with their name.</thinking>

System: ❌ 
Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems like the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This might be because the file contents have changed since we last checked. Let's take a look at the current file contents and try again.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<shell>
cat hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                print("Hello, world!")System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

`print("Hello, world!")`

<thinking>Now that we have the current file contents, let's try patching again. This time, we'll make sure to patch the entire file contents.</thinking>

<tool-use>

<thinking>It seems like the patch is still failing. Let's try a different approach. Instead of patching the file, we can overwrite it with the new contents.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<save args='/tmp/gptme-evals-093r2tel/hello.py'>
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
