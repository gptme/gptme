User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I just need to create a file called hello.py with the print statement.

I'll use the save tool to create this file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:
<think>       <think>
The file has been successfully saved. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed the file was saved to hello.py. I should confirm this is done, or ask if they want to run it.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a simple print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
