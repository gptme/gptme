The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. I can see the current content of hello.py is:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to modify it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print a greeting with their name

I'll use the patch tool to modify this file.

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

-print("Hello, world!")

The patch was successfully applied! The user's hello.py file has been modified to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name.
</think>        </think>

Done! Your `hello.py` now asks for the user's name and greets them with a personalized message.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
