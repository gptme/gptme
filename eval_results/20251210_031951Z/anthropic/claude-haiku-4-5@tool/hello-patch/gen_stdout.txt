User: 
Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

The current content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And it should be changed to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

I'll use the patch tool with the ORIGINAL and UPDATED markers.
