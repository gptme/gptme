Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

The user wants me to patch the file `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I need to use the patch tool to change the string.

The file currently contains:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
```python
print("Hello, human!")
```

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
