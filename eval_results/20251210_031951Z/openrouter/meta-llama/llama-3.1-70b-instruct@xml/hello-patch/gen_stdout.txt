Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<thinking>Let's use the patch tool to modify the code in hello.py. We need to specify the file path and the changes to be made.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<patch args='/tmp/gptme-evals-7gpghyej/hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

+print("Hello, human!")

Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>Error during patch application. The patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the file not being in the expected state or the patch being incorrect. Let me try again with a different approach.</thinking>

Since the file only contains one line, we can use the save tool to overwrite the entire file.

<tool-use>
<save args='/tmp/gptme-evals-7gpghyej/hello.py'>
print("Hello, human!")
</save>
</tool-use>                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
