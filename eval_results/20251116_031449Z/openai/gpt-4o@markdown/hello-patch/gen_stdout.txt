<thinking>It seems there was an issue with the file path. Let's check the current working directory and ensure the file exists before applying the patch.</thinking>

Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to ensure `hello.py` exists. Could you please run the following commands?

```bash
pwd
ls
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
