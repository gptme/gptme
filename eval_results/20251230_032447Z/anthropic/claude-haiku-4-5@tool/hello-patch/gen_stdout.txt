Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple string replacement.

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
