User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call it

I should create a simple Python script that finds the 100th prime number. I can use a simple primality test function.

Let me write an efficient solution:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Find the 100th prime number
3. Print it

I'll use the save tool to create the file, then call it with shell.
