User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the required print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been successfully saved. The user asked me to write the script and I've done that. The confirmation message shows it was saved to hello.py. 

I should probably let the user know it's ready and perhaps suggest they can run it if they want to verify it works. But I should keep it brief since they just asked me to write the script.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like to test it.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
