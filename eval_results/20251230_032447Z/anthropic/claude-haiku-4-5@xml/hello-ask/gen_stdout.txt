The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

The current content is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.
