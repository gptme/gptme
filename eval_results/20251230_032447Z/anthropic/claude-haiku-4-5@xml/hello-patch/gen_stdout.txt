Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

The user wants me to patch hello.py to change "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is straightforward - I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

The file content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And I need to change it to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

This is a simple string replacement.
