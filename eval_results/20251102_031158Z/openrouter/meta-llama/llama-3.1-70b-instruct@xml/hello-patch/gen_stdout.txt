It seems that the file hello.py does not exist in the current working directory. I should check if the file exists before trying to patch it.

Let me check if the file exists. 

<tool-use>
<exec args="ls /tmp/gptme-evals-lhiuum2c/hello.py">
</exec>
</tool-use>                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
