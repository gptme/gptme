User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a Python script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Run the script

I'll create a script that finds the 100th prime number. I'll use a simple approach:
- Check each number to see if it's prime
- Count the primes until we reach 100
- Print the result

Let me write the script and then execute it.
