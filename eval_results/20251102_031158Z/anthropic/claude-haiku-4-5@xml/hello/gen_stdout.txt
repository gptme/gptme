User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the appropriate print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been successfully saved. The user now has a hello.py script that prints "Hello, world!". I should let them know it's ready, and they can run it if they want to verify it works.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created and will print "Hello, world!" when you run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
