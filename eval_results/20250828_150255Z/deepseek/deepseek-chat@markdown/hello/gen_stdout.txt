I'll write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!" to a file called hello.py.

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

print("Hello, world!")

Great! I've created the `hello.py` file with the "Hello, world!" script. The file has been saved successfully.

You can now run it with:
```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                                                                              --- Finished generation ---
