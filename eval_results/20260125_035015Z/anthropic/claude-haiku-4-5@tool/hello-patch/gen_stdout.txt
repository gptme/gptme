Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple string replacement.

I need to use the patch tool with:
- path: hello.py
- patch: replace the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"
