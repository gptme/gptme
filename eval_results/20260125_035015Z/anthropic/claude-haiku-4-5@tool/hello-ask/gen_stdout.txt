The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

Current code:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

New code should:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file.
