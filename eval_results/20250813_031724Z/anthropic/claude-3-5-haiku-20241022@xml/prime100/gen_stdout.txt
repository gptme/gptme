User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script that efficiently computes and prints the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
To solve this, I'll:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run
</thinking>           </thinking>

Great! Let me verify the script works correctly:

<tool-use>
<shell>
python prime.py
</shell>
</tool-use>

python prime.py                                                                 

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Perfect! Let me break down the solution:

1. `is_prime(n)` efficiently checks if a number is prime by:
   - Returning False for numbers less than 2
   - Checking divisibility up to the square root of the number
   - This reduces unnecessary iterations

2. `find_nth_prime(n)` finds the nth prime by:
   - Incrementing a counter each time a prime is found
   - Stopping when the nth prime is reached

3. The `main()` function prints the 100th prime number, which is 541

The script is concise, efficient, and does exactly what was requested. Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
