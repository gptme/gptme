I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.
The original code is a simple print statement, and we need to:
1. Add input() to get the user's name
2. Modify the print statement to use the name variable

I've modified the file to ask for the user's name using input() and then print a personalized greeting using an f-string. The code will now prompt for a name and use it in the greeting.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
