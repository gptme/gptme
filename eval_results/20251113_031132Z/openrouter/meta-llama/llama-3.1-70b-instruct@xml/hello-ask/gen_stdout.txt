<thinking>It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the current directory. I should check if the file exists before trying to patch it.</thinking>

Let me check if the file exists.

<tool-use>
<shell>
ls hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                hello.py
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `ls hello.py`

`hello.py`
