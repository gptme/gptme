The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create hello.py with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirms it was saved to hello.py. I should acknowledge this completion.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a simple print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
