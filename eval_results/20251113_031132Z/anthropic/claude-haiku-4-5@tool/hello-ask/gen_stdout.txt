<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of just printing "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to make this modification.

The current file contains:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Let me use the patch tool with git conflict markers.
