Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<tool-use>
<patch args='/tmp/gptme-evals-802ljnis/hello.py'>

Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:
<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the fact that the file contents were not exactly as expected. Let me try again with a more flexible patch.</thinking>

<thinking>It seems that the patch still failed. This could be due to the fact that the file contents are not exactly as expected. Let me try to read the file and see what the actual contents are.</thinking>
