User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create hello.py with the required content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked for a simple script that prints "Hello, world!" and it's now created at hello.py in the current directory /tmp/gptme-evals-bi98cm78.

I should let the user know it's done, or ask if they want me to run it or do anything else with it.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. Would you like me to run it to verify it works?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
