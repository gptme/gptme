The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'.

I have the current content of hello.py:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print a greeting with their name

I can use the patch tool to make this modification.
