User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number, then call it.

Let me think about the approach:
1. Create a script that finds the 100th prime number
2. Save it to prime.py
3. Run it

For finding prime numbers, I'll need a simple algorithm. The most straightforward approach is to check each number to see if it's prime by testing divisibility up to its square root.

Let me write the script:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
num = 2
while count < 100:
    if is_prime(num):
        count += 1
        if count == 100:
            print(f"The 100th prime number is: {num}")
    num += 1
```

This should work. Let me save it and run it.

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
num = 2
while count < 100:
    if is_prime(num):
        count += 1
        if count == 100:
            print(f"The 100th prime number is: {num}")
    num += 1
