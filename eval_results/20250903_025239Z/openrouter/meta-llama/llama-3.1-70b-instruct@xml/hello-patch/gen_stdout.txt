Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the fact that the file contents were not exactly as expected. Let me try again by reading the current file contents and creating a new patch.</thinking>

First, I will read the current contents of the file using the `cat` command.

<tool-use>
<terminal args="cat /tmp/gptme-evals-pz3qcl6h/hello.py">
</terminal>
</tool-use>

Please execute the above command so I can see the current contents of the file.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
