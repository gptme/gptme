<thinking> To modify the hello.py file, I will use the patch tool to apply a patch that changes the print statement to ask for the user's name and then print a greeting with the name. </thinking>

System: ❌ 
Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking> The patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This is likely because the file contents have changed since I last read it. To fix this, I will re-read the file and try again. </thinking>

<tool-use>
<shell>
cat hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                print("Hello, world!")System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

<thinking> Now that I have the current contents of the file, I can try again to apply the patch. However, since the file only contains a single line, I will use the save tool to overwrite the file with the new contents. </thinking>

<tool-use>
<save args='/tmp/gptme-evals-zuv_c0sm/hello.py'>
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

The hello.py file has been modified to ask the user for their name and print a greeting with the name.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
