User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Here's a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!":

```save /app/hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```                                                                                
Preview
print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ❌ Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from saving the file in the `/app` directory. You might need to adjust the permissions or choose a different directory where I can save the file. Alternatively, you can create the file manually with the following content:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

If you need further assistance with permissions or choosing a different directory, let me know!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
