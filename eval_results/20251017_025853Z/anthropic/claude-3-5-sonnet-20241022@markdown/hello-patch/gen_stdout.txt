Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

I'll patch the file to change the greeting from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"
This is a simple one-line change.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
