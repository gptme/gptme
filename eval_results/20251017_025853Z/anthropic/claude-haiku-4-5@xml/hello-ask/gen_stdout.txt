The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'.

Currently, hello.py just prints "Hello, world!".

I need to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Store it in a variable
3. Print a greeting with their name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")

name = input("What is your name? ")
