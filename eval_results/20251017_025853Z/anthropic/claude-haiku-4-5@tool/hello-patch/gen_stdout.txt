Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I need to use the patch tool to modify the file. The patch should change the string being printed.
