System: ❌ Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'

It seems I don't have permission to write to the `/app` directory. Could you please provide a directory where I can save the `hello.py` script, or adjust the permissions?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
