User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I should do this in the current working directory (/app). Let me break this down:
1. First, initialize a git repo with `git init`
2. Then create a main.py file with `save`
3. Then add and commit it with `git add` and `git commit`

I can do the git init and the save in parallel, but then I need to commit after. Let me start with both the git init and the file creation.

Wait, that initialized git in a different directory. Let me check the current working directory and make sure we're in /app.

I see - the current directory isn't /app as I thought. It's the workspace directory. Let me proceed with creating the main.py file and committing here.
