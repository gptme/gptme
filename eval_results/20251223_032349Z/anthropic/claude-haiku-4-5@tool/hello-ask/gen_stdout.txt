<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of just printing 'Hello, world!'.

I should use the patch tool to modify the file. Let me create a patch that:
1. Removes the current print statement
2. Adds an input() call to ask for the user's name
3. Prints a greeting with the name they entered

Done! The file now asks for the user's name and greets them with it.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
