The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print "Hello, <name>!" instead of just "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to make this modification. Let me patch the file to:
1. Add a line that asks for the user's name
2. Change the print statement to use that name

Here's what I'll do:
- Use input() to ask for the name
- Use an f-string to print the greeting with the name
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>
