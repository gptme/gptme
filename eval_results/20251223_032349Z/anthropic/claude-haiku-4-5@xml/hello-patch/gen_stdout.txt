Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a straightforward patch operation.

I need to use the patch tool to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
