User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let me write a script to find the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
1. We need a function to check if a number is prime
2. We need to count prime numbers until we reach the 100th one
3. We'll use a simple but efficient approach:
   - Check divisibility up to square root of the number
   - Use early return for efficiency
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    
    # Check odd divisors up to square root
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(find_nth_prime(100))
```

Let's test the script to make sure it works correctly:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```
                                                                                
Preview
python3 prime.py                                                                

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script worked correctly! It found that 541 is the 100th prime number.

We can verify this is correct by checking against known prime number lists. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29... and indeed, 541 is confirmed to be the 100th prime number.

The script is efficient for this purpose since:
- It skips even numbers after 2
- Only checks divisors up to square root
- Only tests odd divisors
- Returns early when a divisor is found

Would you like to make any modifications to the script or test it with a different nth prime?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
