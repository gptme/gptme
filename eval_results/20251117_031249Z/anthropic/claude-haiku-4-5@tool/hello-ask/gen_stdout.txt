<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and then print "Hello, <name>!" instead of the current "Hello, world!".

I can use the patch tool to make this modification efficiently.

Done! The script now asks for the user's name and greets them personally.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
