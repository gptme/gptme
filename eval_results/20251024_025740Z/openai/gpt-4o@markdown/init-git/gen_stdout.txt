User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let's start by initializing a git repository, creating a `main.py` file, and then committing it. 

First, I'll initialize the git repository: 
```shell
git init
```

git init                                                                        

Initialized empty Git repository in /home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2025-10-24-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-4o-markdown-22367/workspace/.git/

Ran command: `git init`

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The git repository has been initialized. Now, let's create the `main.py` file with some initial content. I'll write a simple "Hello, World!" program in it. 

```save /app/main.py
print("Hello, World!")
```
                                                                                
Preview
print("Hello, World!")                                                          

System: ❌ Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/main.py'
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems there is a permission issue when trying to write to the `/app` directory. Let's try writing the `main.py` file in the current working directory instead. 

```save main.py
print("Hello, World!")
```                                                                                
Preview
print("Hello, World!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to main.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The `main.py` file has been created successfully. Now, let's add this file to the git repository and commit it.

```shell
git add main.py
git commit -m "Add main.py with a Hello, World! program"
```                                                                                
Preview
git add main.py                                                                 
git commit -m "Add main.py with a Hello, World! program"
