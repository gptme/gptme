I'll modify the hello.py file to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.

<thinking>          <thinking>
1. The current file is a simple one-liner
2. We need to add input() to get the user's name
3. We'll use an f-string for the greeting
4. The patch tool is suitable for this small change
</thinking>           </thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
