User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the file hello.py with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>

<function_calls>
<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: âœ… Saved to hello.py

The file has been saved successfully. The user's request has been completed. I should confirm this was done.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
