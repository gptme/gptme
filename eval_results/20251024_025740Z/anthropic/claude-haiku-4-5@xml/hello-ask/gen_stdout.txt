<think>       <think>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. I need to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print "Hello, <name>!" with the name they provided

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file.

name = input("What is your name? ")
