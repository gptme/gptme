<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with their name. Currently it just prints "Hello, world!".

I need to:
1. Ask for the user's input using input()
2. Store the name
3. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I should use the patch tool to make this modification.
