Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a straightforward patch task.

I need to use the patch tool with:
- path: "hello.py" 
- patch: replace the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"

Let me create the patch with conflict markers showing the ORIGINAL and UPDATED versions.
