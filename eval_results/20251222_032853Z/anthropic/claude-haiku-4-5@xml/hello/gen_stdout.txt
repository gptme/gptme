User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with that content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

Great! The file has been saved successfully. The user now has a hello.py script that prints "Hello, world!". I should confirm this is done and maybe offer to run it if they want to verify it works.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the code to print "Hello, world!". Would you like me to run it to verify it works?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
