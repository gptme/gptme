Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll create a patch for you. 

Here is the patch:

```python
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
