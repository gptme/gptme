To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, I'll update the script accordingly. Let's apply the patch: 

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

The `hello.py` script has been updated to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. Here's the updated content:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

You can now run the script to see the changes in action.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
