Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The file content and desired change are both clear, so I can proceed with the patch.

The patch failed because the content in the file might be different from what was shown.
Let me try the patch with exact content matching, including any potential whitespace.

It seems the file content might be different from what was shown, or there might be encoding or line ending issues. It would be helpful to verify the exact content of the file first.
</thinking>           </thinking>

Could you please confirm the exact content of hello.py? This will help me create an accurate patch.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
