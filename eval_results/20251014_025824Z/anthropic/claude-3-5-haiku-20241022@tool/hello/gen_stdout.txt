I'll use the `save` tool to create the hello.py script.
@save(toolu_016ZAH3XPu3x6Xca2hqDWgwW): {"path": "hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")"}

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I've created a simple Python script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!" when executed. The script is now saved in the current directory (/tmp/gptme-evals-7xm32rtm). 

Would you like me to demonstrate running the script or make any modifications?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
