User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll:
1. Find the current working directory (absolute path).
2. Create main.py with a small script.
3. Initialize a git repository, set local user.name/email (to ensure commit succeeds), add and commit the file.
4. Show the commit summary.
I'll run the commands now.
</thinking>           </thinking>

I'll first print the current working directory so I can reference files with absolute paths:
```shell
pwd
```
                                                                                /home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2025-08-12-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-5-mini-markdown-387124/workspace

Steps:
1. Create /home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2025-08-12-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-5-mini-markdown-387124/workspace/main.py
2. Initialize a git repository in the current workspace.
3. Configure local git user.name and user.email.
4. Add and commit main.py.
5. Show the commit summary.
I'll write the file then run the git commands.
</thinking>           </thinking>

I'll create the main.py file now.
