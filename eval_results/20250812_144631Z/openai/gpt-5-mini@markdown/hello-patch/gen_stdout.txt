Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

I'll update the print string in hello.py from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!" using a small patch.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

<thinking>          <thinking>
I replaced the string in the print call so the script prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
</thinking>           </thinking>

Done — hello.py now prints "Hello, human!". Run `python3 hello.py` to verify.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
