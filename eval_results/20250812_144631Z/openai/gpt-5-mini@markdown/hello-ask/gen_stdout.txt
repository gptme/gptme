1. Read the user's request: update hello.py to ask for the user's name and greet them.
2. Edit hello.py to prompt for input and print "Hello, <name>!".
3. Apply the patch and demonstrate the changed file by running it with a sample input.

1. Confirm the file was patched to prompt for the user's name and print a greeting.
2. Show the absolute path and contents so the user can verify.
3. Provide the command to run the script and an example interaction.
</thinking>           </thinking>

Done — hello.py now asks for the user's name and prints the greeting.

Absolute path:
/home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2025-08-12-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-5-mini-markdown-530783/workspace/hello.py

File contents:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Run it with:
python3 /home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2025-08-12-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-5-mini-markdown-530783/workspace/hello.py

Example interaction:
- Prompt: What is your name?
- If you type: Alice
- Output: Hello, Alice!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
