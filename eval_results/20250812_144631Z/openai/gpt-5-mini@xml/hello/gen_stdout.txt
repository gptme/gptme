I'll create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!" and save it to an absolute path (/tmp/hello.py).

<save args="/tmp/hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>

Confirm file saved and provide how to run it.

Saved to /tmp/hello.py

Run with:
python3 /tmp/hello.py

If you want it executable, I can add a shebang and chmod +x.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
