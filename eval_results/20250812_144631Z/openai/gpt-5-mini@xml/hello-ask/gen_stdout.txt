Done — I updated /home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2025-08-12-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-5-mini-xml-530783/workspace/hello.py to prompt for the user's name and greet them.

File contents:
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

Example run (non-interactive):
$ printf 'Alice\n' | python3 /home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2025-08-12-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-5-mini-xml-530783/workspace/hello.py
What's your name? Hello, Alice!

Run interactively:
