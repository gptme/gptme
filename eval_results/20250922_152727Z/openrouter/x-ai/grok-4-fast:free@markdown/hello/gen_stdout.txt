The file hello.py has been successfully saved. To verify it works, I should suggest running it using the terminal. Since this is a simple script, executing `python hello.py` would print the output and confirm it's correct. I'll use a code block for the command.

To verify the script, run:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    --- Finished generation ---
