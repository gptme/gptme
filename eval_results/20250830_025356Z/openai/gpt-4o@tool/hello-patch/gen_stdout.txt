It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the current directory. Let's first check the contents of the current directory to see if the file is located elsewhere or if it needs to be created.

It seems there was an issue with locating the file `hello.py`. Let's list the contents of the `/app` directory to verify if the file exists or if we need to create it. Could you please run the following command?

```bash
ls /app
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
