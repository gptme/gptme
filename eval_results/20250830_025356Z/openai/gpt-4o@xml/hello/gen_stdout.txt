User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Sure, I'll create a script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!". Here it is:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
``` 

I'll save this to `hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
