The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and then print 'Hello, <name>!'. I should use the patch tool to make this change.

Currently the file has:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print a greeting with that name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Patch successfully applied to

The patch was successfully applied. The user's hello.py file now asks for their name and prints a greeting with that name. The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've updated `hello.py` to ask for the user's name and greet them with it. The script will now:
1. Prompt the user with "What is your name? "
2. Print "Hello, <name>!" with the name they entered                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
