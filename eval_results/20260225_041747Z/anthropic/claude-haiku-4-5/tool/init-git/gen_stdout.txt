User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I'll do this in the current working directory which is /app. I should:
1. Use `git init` to initialize the repository
2. Create a main.py file using the save tool
3. Use `git add main.py` to stage it
4. Use `git commit` to commit it

Let me do all these steps.
