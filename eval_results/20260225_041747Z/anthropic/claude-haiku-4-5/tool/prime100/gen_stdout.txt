User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll create a Python script that finds the 100th prime number. A simple approach is to check numbers for primality until we've found 100 primes.

Let me write the script and then run it.
