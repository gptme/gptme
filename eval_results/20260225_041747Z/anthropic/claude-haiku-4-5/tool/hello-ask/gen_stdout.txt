The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print a greeting with that name. 

I can see the current content of hello.py is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print a greeting with the name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
