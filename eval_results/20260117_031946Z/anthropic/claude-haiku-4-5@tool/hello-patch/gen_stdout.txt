Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". I need to use the patch tool to make this change.

I'll use the patch tool with:
- path: "hello.py" (or the full path if needed, but since it's in the current directory /app, "hello.py" should work)
- patch: the conflict markers showing the change from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"
</thinking>           </thinking>
