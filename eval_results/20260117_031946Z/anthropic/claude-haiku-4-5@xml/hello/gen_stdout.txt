User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user has confirmed that hello.py was created. I should acknowledge this and let them know they can run it if they want. I'll keep it brief since they seem to be getting started.
</think>        </think>

Done! You can run it with `python hello.py` whenever you're ready.                                                                                [03:19:02] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
