User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

Let me do this step by step using the shell tool and save tool.

First, I'll initialize git, then create a main.py file, then commit it.

Good, so the git repo was initialized in the current working directory. Now I need to:
1. Write a main.py file
2. Commit it

Let me create a simple main.py file and then commit it.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="main.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

System: ✅ Saved to main.py

Now I need to commit this file. First I need to add it, then commit it. I should also configure git user if needed.

git config user.email "user@example.com" && git config user.name "User" && git add main.py && git commit -m "Initial commit: add main.py"

Perfect! I've successfully:
1. Initialized a git repository
2. Written a main.py file with a simple print statement
3. Committed it with the message "Initial commit: add main.py"

The user asked for these three things and they're all done now. The output shows the commit was successful with the hash 2f3f13a.

Done! I've:
1. Initialized a git repository
2. Created `main.py` with a simple print statement
3. Committed it with the message "Initial commit: add main.py"

The commit hash is `2f3f13a`.                                                                                [03:19:13] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
