User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I should create a Python script that finds prime numbers and outputs the 100th one. I'll use a simple approach with a function to check if a number is prime, then iterate through numbers until we find the 100th prime.

Let me write this script and save it, then run it.

Great! The script ran successfully and output "The 100th prime number is: 541". The task is complete. The user asked me to write the script and call it, which I've done successfully.

Done! The script computed and printed the 100th prime number: **541**.                                                                                [03:19:11] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
