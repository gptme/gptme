It seems that the file `hello.py` is not located in the current working directory. Let's check the directory structure to locate the file.

It seems that the `hello.py` file is not present in the `/app` directory. Could you please confirm the correct path to the `hello.py` file, or let me know if you would like me to create a new file with the desired functionality?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
