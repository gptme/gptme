System: ‚ùå Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from saving the file in the `/app` directory. You can try running the command with elevated permissions or change the directory permissions to allow writing. Alternatively, I can provide you with the code, and you can manually create the file. Here is the content for `hello.py`:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

You can create the file using a text editor or a command like `echo` in the terminal. Let me know if you need further assistance!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
