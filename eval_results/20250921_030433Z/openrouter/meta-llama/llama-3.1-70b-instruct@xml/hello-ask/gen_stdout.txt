Let's modify the `hello.py` file to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting.

System: ❌ 
Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the file having a different content than expected. Let me check the file again.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<shell>
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-8enbbmgr/hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                print("Hello, human!")System:

<thinking>Now that I have the correct content of the file, I can try to patch it again.</thinking>
