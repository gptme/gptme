The user wants me to patch the file `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

I'll use the patch tool to make this change. The file is in the current working directory `/app`.

The patch should replace the string "Hello, world!" with "Hello, human!"

The patch was successfully applied! The user asked me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!" and I did that. The system confirmed the patch was applied successfully to the file.

I should acknowledge this success briefly.
</think>        </think>

Done! The patch has been applied successfully. The file now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!"                                                                                [04:17:22] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
