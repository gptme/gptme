<think>       <think>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'.

Currently the file has:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I can use the patch tool since the file already exists. Let me create a patch that replaces the print statement with input and a new print statement.
