User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it

The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I'll need to:
1. Use `git init` to initialize a git repository
2. Use `save` to create a main.py file
3. Use `git add` and `git commit` to commit the file

Let me start by checking the current directory and then proceeding with these steps.
