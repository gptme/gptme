The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

I need to:
1. Use the patch tool with the file path "hello.py"
2. Replace the print statement to output "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!"

The patch should show:
- ORIGINAL: print("Hello, world!")
- UPDATED: print("Hello, human!")
</think>        </think>
