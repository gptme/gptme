User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/execute that script

I should create a prime.py file with a function that finds the 100th prime number and prints it. Then I'll execute it.

Let me write a script that:
1. Has a function to check if a number is prime
2. Finds the 100th prime number
3. Prints it when the script is run

I'll use a simple approach - iterate through numbers, check if they're prime, and count until we reach the 100th.
