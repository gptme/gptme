It seems I don't have permission to save the file in the `/app` directory. Let's try saving it in a different location. Could you please specify a directory where I have write access, or would you like me to attempt saving it in a common writable directory like `/tmp`?                                                                                [04:17:10] Session: $0.02 | 2 turns | 2k context | 44% cached
