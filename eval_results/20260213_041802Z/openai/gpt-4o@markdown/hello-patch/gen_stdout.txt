Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll create a patch for you. 

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Patch failed: No such file or directory

It seems there was an issue with applying the patch because the file path was incorrect. Let me correct that by using the absolute path for the file. 

First, let's determine the correct absolute path for `hello.py`. Could you please provide the current working directory or confirm the location of `hello.py`?                                                                                [04:17:09] Session: $0.01 | 1 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
