User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number efficiently.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

print(nth_prime(100))
```

def is_prime(n):                                                                
    if n < 2:                                                                   
        return False                                                            
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):                                       
        if n % i == 0:                                                          
            return False                                                        
    return True                                                                 
                                                                                
def nth_prime(n):                                                               
    count = 0                                                                   
    num = 1                                                                     
    while count < n:                                                            
        num += 1                                                                
        if is_prime(num):                                                       
            count += 1                                                          
    return num                                                                  
                                                                                
print(nth_prime(100))                                                           

System: âœ… Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Now let's run the script to find the 100th prime number:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```                                                                                
Preview
python3 prime.py                                                                

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script has successfully computed and printed that 541 is the 100th prime number. 

Would you like me to verify this result or make any modifications to the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
