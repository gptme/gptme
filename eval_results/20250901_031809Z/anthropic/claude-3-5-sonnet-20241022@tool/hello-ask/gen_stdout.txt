I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.
The file exists and I can see its current content, so I can create a precise patch.

The file has been updated to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. The program will now:
1. Prompt the user for their name
2. Store the input in the `name` variable
3. Print "Hello, " followed by the user's name and an exclamation mark                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
