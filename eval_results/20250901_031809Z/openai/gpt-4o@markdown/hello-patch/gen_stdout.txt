To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", I'll create a patch for you. 

```patch

print("Hello, human!")

It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the current directory. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to ensure the file is present. Could you please run the following commands?

```bash
pwd
ls -la
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
