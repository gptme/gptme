The task is to write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number when called.

py, which calculates and prints the 100th prime number.

<think>       <think>
  
- A prime number is defined as greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
</think>        </think>

<think>       <think>
  
- Need to develop an efficient method to generate prime numbers sequentially to find the 100th one.

## Exploring prime number computation  
- To find the 100th prime, plan to generate primes sequentially until reaching the 100th one.
</think>        </think>

<think>       <think>
  
- The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an option, but for the 100th prime (around 541), efficiency isn't crucial.

<think>       <think>
  
- Will create an is_prime function checking divisibility from 2 to square root of n for prime testing.

<think>       <think>
  
- Intend to loop from 2 upwards, counting primes, and print the number when count reaches 100.
</think>        </think>

<think>       <think>
  

## Planning code implementation  
- Code will include is_prime(n) function: return False for n â‰¤ 1, check divisors up to âˆšn, return True if no divisors found.
</think>        </think>

<think>       <think>
  
- Main logic: increment through numbers, use is_prime to count 100 primes, print the 100th prime.

## Checking file path requirements  
- Instructions emphasize using absolute paths for file references to avoid issues with changing working directories.

Perfect, it printed 541, which is indeed the 100th prime number.

The script `prime.py` has been created and tested. When run with `python prime.py`, it correctly computes and prints the 100th prime number: 541.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
