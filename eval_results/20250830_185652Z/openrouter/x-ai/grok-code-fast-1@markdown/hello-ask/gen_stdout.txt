<think>       <think>
The user wants to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!'.

</think>        </think>

<think>       <think>


## Understanding User Request  
- The user wants to modify hello.
</think>        </think>

<think>       <think>
py to prompt for their name and print a personalized greeting.
</think>        </think>

<think>       <think>
  
- The current script simply prints "Hello, world!" without any interaction.
</think>        </think>

<think>       <think>
  

## Planning Modification  
- Need to add code to ask for the user's name, likely using an input function.
</think>        </think>

<think>       <think>
  
- The greeting should then print "Hello, <name>!" with the user's input replacing <name>.
