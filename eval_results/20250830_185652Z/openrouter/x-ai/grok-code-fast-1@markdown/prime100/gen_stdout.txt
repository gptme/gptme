The user wants a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number when called.

## Defining the Task  
- The user needs a script named prime.

<think>       <think>
py to compute and print the 100th prime number.
</think>        </think>

<think>       <think>
  
- The script must find the 100th number greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

The script ran and printed 541, which is the 100th prime number. That seems correct.

The script `prime.py` has been created and tested. It uses a simple trial division method to check for primality and finds the 100th prime number, which is 541. You can run it anytime with `python prime.py`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
