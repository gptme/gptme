Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

This is a simple patch - I just need to change the string in the print statement.

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file.
