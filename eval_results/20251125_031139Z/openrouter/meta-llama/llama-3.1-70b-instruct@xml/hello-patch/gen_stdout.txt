Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<thinking>Let's use the patch tool to modify the code in hello.py. We need to specify the file path and the changes to be made.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<patch args='/tmp/gptme-evals-y9tnvdf8/hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

+print("Hello, human!")

Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file. This means that the patch tool was unable to find the original code in the file, so it couldn't apply the changes. Let me try again with a different approach.</thinking>

Since the file only contains one line of code, we can use the save tool to overwrite the entire file with the new code.

<tool-use>
<save args='/tmp/gptme-evals-y9tnvdf8/hello.py'>print("Hello, human!")</save>
</tool-use>                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
