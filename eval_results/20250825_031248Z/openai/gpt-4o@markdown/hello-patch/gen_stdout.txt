Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", I'll create a patch for you. 

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

It seems there was an issue with the file path. Let's first check the current working directory to ensure we have the correct path to `hello.py`. Then, I'll apply the patch again. 

Let's list the files in the current directory to locate `hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
