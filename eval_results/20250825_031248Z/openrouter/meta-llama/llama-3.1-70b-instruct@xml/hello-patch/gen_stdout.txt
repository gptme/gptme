Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the fact that the file contents were not exactly as I expected. Let me try again by reading the file contents first.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<exec args='cat /tmp/gptme-evals-ysc_f_lz/hello.py'>
</exec>
</tool-use>                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
