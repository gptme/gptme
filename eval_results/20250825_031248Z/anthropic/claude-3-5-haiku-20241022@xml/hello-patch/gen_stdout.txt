Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll help you patch the `hello.py` file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

Great! The patch was successfully applied to `hello.py`, changing the greeting from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this file or any other tasks you have in mind?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
