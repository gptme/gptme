User: 
Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple string replacement.

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
