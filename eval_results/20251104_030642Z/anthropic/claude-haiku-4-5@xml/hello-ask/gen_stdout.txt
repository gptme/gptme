The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. 

The current file contains:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' with the name they provided

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.

name = input("What is your name? ")

Great! The patch was successfully applied. The file has been modified to ask the user for their name and then print a greeting with that name. The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script now asks for the user's name and greets them with it.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
