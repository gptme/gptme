User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let's create the `hello.py` script with the desired output.

```python
print("Hello, world!")
``` 

I'll save this to `hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
