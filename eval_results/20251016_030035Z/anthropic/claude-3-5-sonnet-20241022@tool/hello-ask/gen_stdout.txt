<thinking>          <thinking>
1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file to add user input functionality
2. I can use the patch tool since we have the original content and want to make a specific change
3. The change is simple: replace the print statement with input and formatted print

1. Prompt the user for their name
2. Store the input in the `name` variable
3. Print "Hello, " followed by the entered name and an exclamation mark                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
