User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

Let's write a script to find the 100th prime number. We'll need:
1. A function to check if a number is prime
2. A loop to count prime numbers until we reach the 100th one
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
num = 1
while count < 100:
    num += 1
    if is_prime(num):
        count += 1

print(num)
```

    if n < 2:                                                                   
        return False

        if n % i == 0:                                                          
            return False

count = 0                                                                       
num = 1                                                                         
while count < 100:

Now let's run the script to find the 100th prime number:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script has successfully computed and printed that 541 is the 100th prime number. 

Would you like me to verify this result or make any modifications to the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
