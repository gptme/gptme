User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To achieve this, I'll write a Python script that calculates the 100th prime number and prints it. Then, I'll execute the script to display the result.

Let's start by writing the script `prime.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
