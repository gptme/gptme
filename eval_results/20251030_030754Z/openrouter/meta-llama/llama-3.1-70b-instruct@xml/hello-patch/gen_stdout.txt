<thinking> It seems that the file hello.py does not exist in the current working directory. I should check if the file exists before trying to patch it. Let me try to create the file first. </thinking>

<tool-use>
<save args='/tmp/gptme-evals-yj3918ue/hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

Please execute the above command to create the hello.py file. After that, I can try to patch it again.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
