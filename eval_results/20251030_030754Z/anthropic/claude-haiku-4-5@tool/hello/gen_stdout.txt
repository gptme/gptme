The user wants me to create a Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I need to use the save tool to create a file called hello.py with the appropriate print statement.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a simple print statement that outputs "Hello, world!". You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
