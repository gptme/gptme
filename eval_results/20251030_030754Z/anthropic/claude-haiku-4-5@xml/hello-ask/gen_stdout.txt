The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with it. I should use the patch tool to modify the file.

Looking at the current content:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print "Hello, <name>!" using that name

Let me apply a patch to make this change.

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

The patch was successfully applied. The file now asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting. The task is complete.

Done! I've modified hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. The script will now prompt the user for their name and respond with "Hello, <name>!"                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
