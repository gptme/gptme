Here's a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!":

```save /app/hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

System: ‚ùå Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from saving the file in the `/app` directory. You can try running the command with elevated permissions or change the directory permissions to allow writing. Alternatively, I can guide you on how to create the file manually. Would you like to proceed with any of these options?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
