User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To compute the 100th prime number, we can use a simple algorithm that checks each number for primality until we find the 100th prime. Let's write the script `prime.py` to achieve this.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Compute and print the 100th prime number
nth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(nth_prime)
```

Now, let's save this script to `prime.py` and execute it.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
