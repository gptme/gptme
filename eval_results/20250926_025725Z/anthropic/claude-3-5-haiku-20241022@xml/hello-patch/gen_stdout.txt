Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll help you patch the `hello.py` file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

System: âœ… Patch successfully applied to `hello.py`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Great! The patch was successfully applied. The `hello.py` file now contains the updated line printing "Hello, human!" instead of the original "Hello, world!" message. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this file or project?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
