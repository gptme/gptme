Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The file content and desired change are both clear, so I can proceed with the patch.

The patch failed because the content in the file might be different from what was shown.
Let me try again with the exact content that might be in the file, accounting for possible whitespace or newline differences.

I'm having trouble applying the patch. It seems the file content might be different from what was shown, or there might be an issue with the file. Could you please verify the exact content of the file?
</thinking>           </thinking>

Could you please confirm the exact content of hello.py? This will help me create the correct patch.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
