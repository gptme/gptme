System: ‚ùå Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from writing to the `/app` directory. You can try running the command with elevated permissions or change the permissions of the directory. Alternatively, I can provide you with the code, and you can create the file manually. Here is the code for `hello.py`:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Let me know how you would like to proceed!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
