Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I need to use the patch tool to change the string.

I'll use the patch tool to change "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")

print("Hello, human!")
