The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. I should use the patch tool to modify the file.

Current content:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

New content should:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print "Hello, <name>!" with the name they provided

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
