Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the fact that the file contents were not exactly as expected. Let me try again with a more flexible patch.</thinking>

<thinking>It seems that the patch still failed. This time, I will try to patch the entire file, as the file seems to be very small.</thinking>

<thinking>It seems that the patch still failed. This time, I will try to read the file to see what's in it.</thinking>
