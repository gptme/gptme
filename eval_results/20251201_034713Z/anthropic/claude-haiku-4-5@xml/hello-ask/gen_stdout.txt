The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. I need to:
1. Read input from the user
2. Store it in a variable
3. Print a greeting with that name

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file.

print("Hello, world!")

name = input("What is your name? ")
