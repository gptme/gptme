Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". 

I'll use the patch tool to make this change. I need to:
1. Identify the original line: `print("Hello, world!")`
2. Replace it with: `print("Hello, human!")`

This is straightforward - just a simple string replacement in the print statement.

The patch was successfully applied. The user asked me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", and it's been done. The system confirmed the patch was applied to the file.

I should acknowledge the success. Since the user prefers not to have basic concepts explained, I'll keep my response brief.
