User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll need to:
1. Create a prime.py file with a function to find prime numbers
2. Find the 100th prime number
3. Execute the script

Let me write a simple but efficient prime number finder.
