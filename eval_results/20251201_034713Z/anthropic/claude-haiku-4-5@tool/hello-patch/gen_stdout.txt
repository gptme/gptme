Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". I need to use the patch tool to make this change.

I'll use the conflict markers format to replace the print statement.

The file doesn't exist at the path I tried. Let me check what the current working directory actually is and create the file first.
