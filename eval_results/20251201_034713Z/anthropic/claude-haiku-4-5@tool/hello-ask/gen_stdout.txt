<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of just printing 'Hello, world!'.

I should use the patch tool to make this modification since the file already exists and I just need to change a small part of it.

The original line is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

The updated version should:
1. Ask for the user's name with input()
2. Print the greeting with the user's name

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Let me use the patch tool to make this change.
