Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", I'll create a patch for you. 

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Let's apply the patch: 

<tool-use>
<patch args='/tmp/gptme-evals-tytgaumb/hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

+print("Hello, human!")

It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the expected directory. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to locate `hello.py`. 

Please execute the following commands:

```bash
pwd
ls -la /tmp/gptme-evals-tytgaumb
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
