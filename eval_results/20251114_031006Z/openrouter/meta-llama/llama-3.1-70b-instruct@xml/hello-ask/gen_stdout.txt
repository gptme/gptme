<thinking> To modify the existing `hello.py` file, I will use the `patch` tool to apply a small change. I will replace the existing print statement with a new one that asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting. </thinking>

System: ❌ 
Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file

<thinking> The patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This might be due to the file contents being different from what I expected. Let me try again by reading the file contents first and then applying the patch. </thinking>

<thinking> Now that I have the correct file contents, I can apply the patch again. This time, I will replace the existing print statement with a new one that asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting. </thinking>
