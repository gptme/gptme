User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create hello.py with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool_use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool_use>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
