Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

This is a simple change - I just need to replace "Hello, world!" with "Hello, human!" in the print statement.

Let me use the patch tool to make this change.
