Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Sure! I'll create a script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!". 

```save /app/hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

System: ❌ Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from saving the file in the `/app` directory. You might need to adjust the permissions or choose a different directory where I can save the file. Could you let me know how you'd like to proceed?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
