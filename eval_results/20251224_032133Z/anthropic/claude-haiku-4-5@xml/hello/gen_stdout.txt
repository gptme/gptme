The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

The user's file has been saved successfully. I should acknowledge this and let them know it's ready to run.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` is ready. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
