The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. I should use the patch tool to make this change.

Current code:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

New code should:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.
