Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a straightforward patch task.

I need to use the patch tool to modify the file. The original line is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And I need to change it to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

Let me apply the patch.

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>
