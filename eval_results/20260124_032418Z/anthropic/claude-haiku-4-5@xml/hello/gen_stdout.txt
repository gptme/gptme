The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll create the file using the save tool.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

The file has been saved successfully. The user's task is complete. I've created hello.py with the print statement for "Hello, world!". I should confirm this is done and maybe offer to help with running it if they want.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a simple print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:23:15] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 956 context | 0% cached
