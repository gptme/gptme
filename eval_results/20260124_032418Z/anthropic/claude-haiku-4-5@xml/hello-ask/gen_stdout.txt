The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name instead of just printing a static message. I should use the patch tool to modify the file.

The current content is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print a greeting with their name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

Great! The patch was successfully applied. The user asked me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. I've done that by:

1. Using `input()` to ask the user for their name
2. Using an f-string to print a personalized greeting

The modification is complete. Since the user just wanted the task done and given their preference not to explain basic concepts, I should keep my response brief.

Done! The file now asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting.                                                                                [03:23:16] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
