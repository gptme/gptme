User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call the script to run it

I'll write a Python script that finds the 100th prime number. I can use a simple algorithm to find primes.

Let me write this script and then execute it.
