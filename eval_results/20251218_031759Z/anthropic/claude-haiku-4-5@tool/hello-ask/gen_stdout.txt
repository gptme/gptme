<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print "Hello, <name>!" instead of the current "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to modify this file. The change is:
- Replace `print("Hello, world!")` with code that asks for the user's name and prints it

Let me create a patch that:
1. Gets the user's name using input()
2. Prints "Hello, <name>!"
</thinking>           </thinking>
@patch(toolu_01WUiULcofYEHz183BpDnSaP): {"path": "hello.py", "patch": "<<<<<<< ORIGINAL\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n=======\nname = input(\"What is your name? \")\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n>>>>>>> UPDATED"}
