User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll use the `save` tool to create the Python script.
@save(toolu_01R5w83CijP7zVaUakUaA5Hf): {"path": "hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")"}

print("Hello, world!")

I've created a simple Python script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!" when executed. The script is now saved in the current directory (/tmp/gptme-evals-51s1lm02). You can run it using Python, and it will output the classic greeting.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
