User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll use the following approach:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run
</thinking>           </thinking>

System: 
Ran command: `python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-taiqnop2/prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let me explain the script:
- `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
- `find_nth_prime(n)` finds the nth prime number by incrementing through numbers and counting primes
- `main()` prints the 100th prime number
- The script prints 541, which is indeed the 100th prime number

The script can be run directly, and it will always output the 100th prime number. Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
