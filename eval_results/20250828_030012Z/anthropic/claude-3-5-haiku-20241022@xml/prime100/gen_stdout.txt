User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
To solve this, I'll:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run

<shell>python /tmp/gptme-evals-odlg48hi/prime.py</shell>
</tool-use>

python /tmp/gptme-evals-odlg48hi/prime.py                                       

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python /tmp/gptme-evals-odlg48hi/prime.py`

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Great! Let me explain the script briefly:

1. `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime(n)` finds the nth prime number by incrementing through numbers and counting primes
3. `main()` specifically finds the 100th prime number and prints it
4. The script outputs 541, which is indeed the 100th prime number

The algorithm is straightforward and efficient for small n. For very large n, more optimized methods like the Sieve of Eratosthenes would be recommended.

Would you like me to modify the script or explain any part of it in more detail?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
