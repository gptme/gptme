User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll help you write a script to find the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
1. We need a function to check if a number is prime
2. We need to count prime numbers until we reach the 100th one
3. We'll use a simple but efficient approach by checking divisibility up to sqrt(n)

python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-2epevf8x/prime.py                                      

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-2epevf8x/prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script successfully found the 100th prime number, which is 541. 

<thinking>          <thinking>
Let me verify this result:
- The first few prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...
- 541 is indeed prime (it's not divisible by any number except 1 and itself)
- A quick check against mathematical references confirms that 541 is indeed the 100th prime number

The script is working correctly. Would you like to make any modifications or improvements to it?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
