<thinking>          <thinking>
1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file to add user input functionality
2. I can use the patch tool since we're making a small modification to an existing file
3. The change will replace the simple print with an input statement and formatted string

I've modified hello.py to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Store it in a variable called 'name'
3. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

The program will now interact with the user and provide a personalized greeting.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
