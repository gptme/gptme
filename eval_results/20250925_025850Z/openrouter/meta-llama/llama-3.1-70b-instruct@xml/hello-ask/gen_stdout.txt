Let's modify the `hello.py` file to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting.

System: ❌ 
Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the fact that the file contents have changed since we last read it. Let's try to read the file again and then apply the patch.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<shell>
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-6fzhj3uu/hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                print("Hello, human!")System:

Now that we have the latest file contents, let's try to apply the patch again.
