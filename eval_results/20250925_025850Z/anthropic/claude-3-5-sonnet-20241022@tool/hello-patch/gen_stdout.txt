Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The file content and desired change are both clear, so I can proceed with the patch.

I see the patch failed because the file doesn't exist at the specified path. Let me check if I need to adjust the path or ask for clarification about the file location.

The error shows we're actually in a different working directory than what was initially provided. I should ask the user to confirm the correct location of the file.
</thinking>           </thinking>

Could you please confirm the exact location of the hello.py file? The file doesn't seem to be at the expected path.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
