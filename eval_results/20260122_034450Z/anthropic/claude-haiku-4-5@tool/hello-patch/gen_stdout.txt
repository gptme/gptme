Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

The file currently contains:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And needs to be changed to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

I'll use the patch tool with the git conflict markers format.

The file doesn't exist at /app/hello.py. Let me check what the current working directory is and create the file if needed. Let me first understand the workspace better.
