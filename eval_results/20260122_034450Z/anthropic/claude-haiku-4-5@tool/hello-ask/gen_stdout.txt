<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name instead of just printing "Hello, world!". I should use the patch tool to make this modification.

The current content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print "Hello, <name>!" using the name they provided

I'll use the patch tool with conflict markers to make this change.
