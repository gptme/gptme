The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print a greeting with that name. I should use the patch tool to modify the file. Looking at the current content, it just prints "Hello, world!". I need to:

1. Use input() to ask the user for their name
2. Store it in a variable
3. Print a greeting with the name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
