User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a file called hello.py in the current working directory (/app).
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")

The file has been successfully saved. The user's task is complete. I should confirm this is done and maybe offer to help them run it or do something else with it.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script has been saved to `/app/hello.py`. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:43:57] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 969 context | 0% cached
