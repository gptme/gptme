User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run that script

I should write a Python script that finds prime numbers and identifies the 100th one.

Let me write a simple prime checking function and iterate until I find 100 primes.
