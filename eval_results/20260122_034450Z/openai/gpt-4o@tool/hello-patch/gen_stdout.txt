It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the current directory. Let's first check the contents of the current directory to see if the file is located elsewhere or if it needs to be created.

It seems there was an issue with accessing the file. Let's list the contents of the `/app` directory to verify the presence of `hello.py`. Could you please execute the following command?

```bash
ls /app
```                                                                                [03:43:45] Session: $0.02 | 3 turns | 1k context | 61% cached
