Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

Let's update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". I'll create a patch for this change.

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>

print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>
