I'll modify the hello.py file to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.

<thinking>          <thinking>
1. The file is simple, containing just one line
2. We need to:
   - Add input() to get the name
   - Use an f-string to print the personalized greeting
3. Since it's a small file, we can use either patch or save
4. For such a small change, save is more straightforward
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save hello.py
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

The file has been updated. Now when you run it, it will:
1. Ask for your name using input()
2. Print a personalized greeting using that name

Would you like me to show you how it runs, or would you like to make any other modifications?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
