User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it

I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number efficiently.

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

    print(find_nth_prime(100))

Preview
python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-xw7ri9av/prime.py                                      

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-xw7ri9av/prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script has successfully computed and printed that 541 is the 100th prime number. The program worked as intended, using a straightforward implementation that:

1. Checks if numbers are prime by testing divisibility up to their square root
2. Counts prime numbers until it reaches the 100th one
3. Prints the result (541)

Would you like to verify this result or make any modifications to the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
