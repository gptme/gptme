To modify `hello.py` to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, we can use the `input` function to get the user's name and then print the greeting. Here's the updated code:

```save hello.py
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py (overwritten)
