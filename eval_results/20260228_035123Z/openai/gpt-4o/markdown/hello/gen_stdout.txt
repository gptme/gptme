It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from writing to the `/app` directory. You can try running the command with elevated permissions or change the permissions of the directory. Alternatively, I can provide you with the code, and you can create the file manually. Here is the content for `hello.py`:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Let me know how you would like to proceed!                                                                                [03:50:19] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 772 context | 0% cached
