Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll create a patch for you. 

Here is the patch:

```patch
<<<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                [03:50:24] Session: $0.01 | 1 turns | 936 context | 0% cached
