The error is expected - in non-interactive mode, there's no stdin input available. The code is correct; the EOFError just means there was no input provided when running non-interactively. The implementation is fine.
</think>        </think>

The code is correct — the `EOFError` just means no input was provided in non-interactive mode. It works as expected when run interactively.                                                                                [03:50:40] Session: $0.02 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
