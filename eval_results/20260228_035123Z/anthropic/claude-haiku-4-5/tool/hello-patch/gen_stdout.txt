The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". I need to use the patch tool to make this change.

I'll use the patch tool with:
- path: "hello.py"
- patch: The git conflict marker format showing the original and updated lines
</think>        </think>
