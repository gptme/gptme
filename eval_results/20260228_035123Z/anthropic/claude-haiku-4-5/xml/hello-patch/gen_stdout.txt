The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. The patch should replace the string "Hello, world!" with "Hello, human!".
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
