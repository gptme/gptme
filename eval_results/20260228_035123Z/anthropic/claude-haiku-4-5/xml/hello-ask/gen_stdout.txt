The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. 

I can see the current content of hello.py:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change this to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print a greeting with their name

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

The patch was successfully applied to hello.py. The file now asks the user for their name and prints a greeting with their name.

Let me verify by showing the user the updated file, or I could offer to run it. Since they can see the patch was applied, I should just confirm the task is complete. Actually, let me just acknowledge that the patch was applied successfully.
</think>        </think>

Done! The `hello.py` file has been updated to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
