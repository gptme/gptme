User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call the script

Let me write a script that finds the 100th prime number. I'll use a simple approach - check each number to see if it's prime by testing divisibility.

Here's my approach:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Loop through numbers, counting primes until we reach the 100th one
3. Print the result

Let me write this script.
