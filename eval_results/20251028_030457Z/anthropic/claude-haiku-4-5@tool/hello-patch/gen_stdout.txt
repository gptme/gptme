Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a straightforward patch operation.

I need to use the patch tool with:
- path: hello.py (or the full path if needed)
- patch: change "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"

Let me create the patch using git conflict markers.
