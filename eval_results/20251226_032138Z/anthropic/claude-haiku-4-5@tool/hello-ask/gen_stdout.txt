<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' with the name they provided

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file. The current content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
```
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Let me apply this patch.
