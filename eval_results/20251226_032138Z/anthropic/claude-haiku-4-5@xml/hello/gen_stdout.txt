The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

<think>       <think>
The file has been successfully saved. The user's request is complete. I should acknowledge this briefly.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
