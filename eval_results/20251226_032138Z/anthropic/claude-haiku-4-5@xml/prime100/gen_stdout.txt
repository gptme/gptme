User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a Python script that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

Let me write a script that finds prime numbers efficiently and returns the 100th one.

I'll use a simple approach with a prime checking function:

    return True

Done! The script computed that the 100th prime number is **541**.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
