<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting. Currently it just prints "Hello, world!". I need to:
1. Use input() to ask for the user's name
2. Store it in a variable
3. Print a greeting with that name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
