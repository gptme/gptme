<thinking>          <thinking>
1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file to add user input functionality
2. I can use the patch tool since we have the original content and want to make a specific change
3. The change is simple: replace the print statement with input and formatted print

I've modified the hello.py file to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Store it in a variable called 'name'
3. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

The program will now interact with the user instead of just printing a static message.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
