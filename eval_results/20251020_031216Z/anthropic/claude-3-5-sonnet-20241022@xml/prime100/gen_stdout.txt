User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it

I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number efficiently.

    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1

Now let's run the script to find the 100th prime number:

Preview
python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-_dwl6g00/prime.py                                      

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-_dwl6g00/prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script successfully ran and found that the 100th prime number is 541. 

To verify this is correct:
1. 541 is indeed prime (it's only divisible by 1 and itself)
2. If we count prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, ... 541 is indeed the 100th one in the sequence.

Would you like to modify the script in any way or would you like to find a different nth prime number?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
