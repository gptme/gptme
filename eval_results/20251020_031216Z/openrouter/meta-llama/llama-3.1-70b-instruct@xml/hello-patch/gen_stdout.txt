<thinking>It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the current working directory. I should check if the file exists before attempting to patch it.</thinking>

Let me try to create the file `hello.py` first. 

<tool-use>
<save args='/tmp/gptme-evals-ltferg6v/hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

Please execute the above command to create the file. After that, I can try to patch it again.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
