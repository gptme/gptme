Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll apply a patch to modify the print statement. 

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

It seems there was an issue with applying the patch. Let's first check the current working directory to ensure we're in the right place, and then list the files to confirm the presence of `hello.py`. After that, I'll apply the patch again. 

Let's start by checking the current directory and listing the files. Please execute the following commands:

```bash
pwd
ls
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
