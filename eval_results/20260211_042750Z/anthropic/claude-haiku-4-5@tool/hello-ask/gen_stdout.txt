The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. 

I have the current content of hello.py:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' where <name> is what they entered

I can use the patch tool to make this change. The patch should replace the single print statement with code that asks for the name and then prints the greeting.

Let me apply the patch:
