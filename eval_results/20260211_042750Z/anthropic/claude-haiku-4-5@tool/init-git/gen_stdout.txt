User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it

The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

Let me do these steps:
1. First, initialize git with `git init`
2. Create a main.py file with some basic content
3. Add the file with `git add`
4. Commit with `git commit`

I can do these in sequence.
