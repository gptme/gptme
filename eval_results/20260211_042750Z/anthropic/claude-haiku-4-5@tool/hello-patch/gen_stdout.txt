User: 
Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". 

I need to use the patch tool with:
- path: "hello.py" (though I should consider using absolute path - the working directory is /app, so it would be /app/hello.py)
- patch: A git-style conflict marker showing the change

The original line is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And it should be changed to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

Let me create the patch:
```
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

I should use the absolute path /app/hello.py to be safe.
