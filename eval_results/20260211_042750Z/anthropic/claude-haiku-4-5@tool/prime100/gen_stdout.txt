User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Create a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Execute the script

I'll create a script that finds the 100th prime number. I can use a simple algorithm to check if numbers are prime and count until we reach 100 primes.

Let me write the script and then execute it.
