<thinking>Let's use the patch tool to modify the existing hello.py file. We'll replace the print statement with a new one that asks for the user's name and then prints a greeting.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
