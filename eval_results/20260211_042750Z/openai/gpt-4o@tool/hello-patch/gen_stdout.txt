It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the `/app` directory. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to locate `hello.py`.

It seems there is a persistent issue with locating the file `hello.py`. Let's try a different approach by checking the directory structure to find the correct location of the file. Could you please provide the correct path or confirm if the file exists in the current directory?                                                                                [04:26:39] Session: $0.02 | 4 turns | 1k context | 69% cached
