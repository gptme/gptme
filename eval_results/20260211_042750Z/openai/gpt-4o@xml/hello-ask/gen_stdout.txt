To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, I'll update the script accordingly. Let's apply the patch: 

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ✅ Patch successfully applied to

The `hello.py` script has been updated to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. The updated script now looks like this:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

You can run the script to see the changes in action.                                                                                [04:26:42] Session: $0.02 | 2 turns | 2k context | 50% cached
