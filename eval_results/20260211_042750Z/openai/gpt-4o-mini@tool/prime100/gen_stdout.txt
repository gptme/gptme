User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it

It seems that I don't have permission to create or modify files in the `/app` directory. Let's check the permissions of the current directory to understand the issue better. I'll run a command to list the permissions.
@shell(call_Dbrgqdt4UyGPwon0qRGY7s45): {"command":"ls -ld /app"}                                                                                drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Feb 10 14:44 /app
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `ls -ld /app`

`drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Feb 10 14:44 /app`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The `/app` directory is owned by the `root` user, which is why I cannot create or modify files there. 

To proceed, I can either suggest a different directory where you have write permissions, or you can run the script manually. Would you like to specify a different directory, or should I provide the script for you to run?                                                                                [04:26:54] Session: $0.00 | 4 turns | 2k context | 71% cached
