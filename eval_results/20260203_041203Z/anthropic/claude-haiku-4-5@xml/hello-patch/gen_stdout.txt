Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

This is a simple change - I just need to replace "world" with "human" in the print statement.

Let me use the patch tool to make this change.

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>
