User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/execute the script

I'll write a simple prime number generator that finds the 100th prime number.

A straightforward approach:
- Create a function to check if a number is prime
- Keep counting primes until we reach the 100th one
- Print the result

Let me write this script and then run it.

<tool-use>
<save args="prime.py">
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1
    return num

print(find_nth_prime(100))
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to prime.py

Now I need to execute the script using the shell tool.

That's strange. The file should have been saved. Let me check the current directory and see what's there.

Ah, the working directory is different from what I thought. The current working directory is `/home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-02-03-gptme-evals-anthropic--claude-haiku-4-5-xml-4c86a913/workspace`, not `/app`. I should use the correct path or check what's in the current directory.

Let me list the files in the current directory first to confirm where prime.py was saved.

Good, prime.py is in the current directory. Let me run it with the correct path.
</think>        </think>

Perfect! The script ran successfully and output 541, which is the 100th prime number. The task is complete.

Done! The 100th prime number is **541**.                                                                                [04:11:26] Session: $0.01 | 4 turns | 3k context | 0% cached
