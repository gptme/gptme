The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". 

I need to use the patch tool to modify the file. The file is in the current directory /app, so the path should be /app/hello.py.

The patch needs to:
- Original: `print("Hello, world!")`
- Updated: `print("Hello, human!")`
</think>        </think>
