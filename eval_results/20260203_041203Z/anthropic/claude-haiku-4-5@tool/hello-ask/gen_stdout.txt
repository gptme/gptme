<think>       <think>
The user wants me to modify the hello.py file to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. I can see the current content is just `print("Hello, world!")`.

I need to:
1. Use input() to ask for the user's name
2. Store it in a variable
3. Print the greeting with the name

I'll use the patch tool to modify this file.
