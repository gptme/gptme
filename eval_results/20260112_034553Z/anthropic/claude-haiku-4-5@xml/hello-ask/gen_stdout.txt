The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print a greeting with their name. I should use the patch tool to make this change.

The current file has:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

Let me use the patch tool to modify this.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

The patch was successfully applied. The user's hello.py file has been modified to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. The task is complete.

Done! The file now asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting.                                                                                [03:45:03] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
