Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple change.

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification. The original line is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And it should be changed to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

Let me apply the patch.

<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")

print("Hello, human!")
