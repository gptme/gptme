User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward. I should use the save tool to create a file called hello.py in the current working directory (/app).
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a hello.py script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed it was saved to hello.py. 

I could offer to run it to show that it works, but the user's preferences say not to explain basic concepts, and they haven't asked me to run it. So I'll just confirm it's been created and offer to run it if they want.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a simple print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like to see it in action.                                                                                [03:44:59] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 969 context | 0% cached
