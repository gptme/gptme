User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the appropriate print statement.

System: ❌ Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

I got a permission denied error. Let me check the current working directory and the permissions for /app. I should use pwd to see where I am and then try saving to a path where I have write permissions. Let me try a relative path instead.
</thinking>           </thinking>

Let me try saving to the current directory with a relative path:
@save(toolu_01A5CvHAsoVLzwTt6wGftFNf): {"path": "hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")"}

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Done! I've created `hello.py` with the content `print("Hello, world!")`. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:45:01] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
