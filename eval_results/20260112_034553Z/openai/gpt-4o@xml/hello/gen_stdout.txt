It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from saving the file in the `/app` directory. You might need to adjust the permissions or choose a different directory where I can save the file. Could you let me know how you'd like to proceed?                                                                                [03:44:51] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 802 context | 0% cached
