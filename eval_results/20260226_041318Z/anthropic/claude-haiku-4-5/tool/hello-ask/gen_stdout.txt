<think>       <think>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. I can see the current content of hello.py from the code block they provided.

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file. The change is simple - I need to:
1. Add an input() call to ask for the user's name
2. Use an f-string to print the greeting with the name

Let me create a patch to update the file.
