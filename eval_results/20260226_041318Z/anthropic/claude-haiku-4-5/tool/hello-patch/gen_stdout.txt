Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<think>       <think>
The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple change using the patch tool.

I need to:
1. Use the patch tool to modify hello.py
2. Change the string from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"

The patch should be straightforward - just replace the old string with the new one.
