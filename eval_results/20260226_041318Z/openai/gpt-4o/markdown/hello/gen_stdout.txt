It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from writing to the `/app` directory. You might need to adjust the permissions or run the command with elevated privileges. Alternatively, I can guide you on how to create the file manually. Would you like to proceed with that?                                                                                [04:12:11] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 772 context | 0% cached
