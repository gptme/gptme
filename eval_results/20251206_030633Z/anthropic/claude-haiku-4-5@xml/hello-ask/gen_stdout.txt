The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and greet them. They've provided the current content of hello.py which is just `print("Hello, world!")`.

I need to use the patch tool to modify this file to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print a greeting with that name

This is a simple change, so I'll use the patch tool.

print("Hello, world!")

name = input("What is your name? ")
