Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. The file is in the current working directory which is /tmp/gptme-evals-ck121bpz, so I can refer to it as hello.py or use the absolute path /tmp/gptme-evals-ck121bpz/hello.py.

Let me apply a simple patch to change the string.

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>
