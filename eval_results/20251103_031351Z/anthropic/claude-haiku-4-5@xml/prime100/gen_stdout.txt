User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run that script

I'll create a simple prime number generator script that finds the 100th prime and prints it.

Let me write an efficient prime number checker and find the 100th prime.
