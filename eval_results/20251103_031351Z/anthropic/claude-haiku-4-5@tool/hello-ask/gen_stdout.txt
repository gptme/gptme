<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify the hello.py file to ask the user for their name and then print 'Hello, <name>!'. 

I can see the current content of hello.py:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' with the user's input

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.
