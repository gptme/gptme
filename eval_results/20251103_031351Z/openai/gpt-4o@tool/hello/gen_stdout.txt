System: ❌ Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'

It seems I don't have permission to write to the `/app` directory. Could you please run the following command to create the `hello.py` script?

```bash
echo 'print("Hello, world!")' > /app/hello.py
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
