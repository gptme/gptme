Let's start by initializing a git repository, creating a `main.py` file, and then committing it. Here are the steps:

1. Initialize a git repository.
2. Create a `main.py` file with some initial content.
3. Add the file to the staging area.
4. Commit the changes.

I'll execute these steps for you. Let's begin by initializing the git repository.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
