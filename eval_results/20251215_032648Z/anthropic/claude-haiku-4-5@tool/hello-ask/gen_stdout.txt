<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'.

The current content is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to ask for the user's name and then print it. I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.
