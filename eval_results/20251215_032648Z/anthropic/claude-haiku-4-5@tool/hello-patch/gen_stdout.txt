Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple string replacement.

I need to use the patch tool to change the print statement from:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```
to:
```python
print("Hello, human!")
```

I'll use the patch tool with the appropriate conflict markers.
