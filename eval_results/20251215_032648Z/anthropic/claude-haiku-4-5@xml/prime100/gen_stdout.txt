User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/execute the script

I should write a script that finds the 100th prime number. A simple approach is to check each number to see if it's prime by testing divisibility.

Let me create the script first, then run it.
