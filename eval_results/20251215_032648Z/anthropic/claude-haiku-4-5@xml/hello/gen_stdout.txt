User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create hello.py with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been saved successfully. The user has confirmed that hello.py was created with the content that prints "Hello, world!". 

I should let them know it's done. I could offer to run it if they'd like, but I'll keep it brief since they seem to prefer conciseness.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the script. You can run it with:
```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
