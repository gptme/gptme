Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

<thinking>I will use the patch tool to modify the existing file hello.py. I will replace the string "Hello, world!" with "Hello, human!".</thinking>

Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file

<thinking>The patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the file contents being different from what I expected. I will try to read the file contents to see what's actually in the file.</thinking>
