Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll apply a patch to modify the print statement. Here is the patch:

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

It seems there was an issue with the file path. Let's first check the current working directory to ensure we have the correct path to `hello.py`. Then, I'll apply the patch again. Let me find the correct path for you.                                                                                [03:26:40] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
