<think>       <think>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. Currently it just prints "Hello, world!".

I need to:
1. Use input() to ask for the user's name
2. Print a greeting with the name in the format 'Hello, <name>!'

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
