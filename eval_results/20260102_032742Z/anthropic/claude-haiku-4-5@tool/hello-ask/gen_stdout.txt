The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and then print a greeting with that name. I'll use the patch tool to update the file.

Current content:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

New content should:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I'll use the patch tool with git conflict markers to make this change.
