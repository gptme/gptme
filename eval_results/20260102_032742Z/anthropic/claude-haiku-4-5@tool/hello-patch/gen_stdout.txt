User: 
Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple string replacement.

I'll use the patch tool to make this change. The original line is:
    print("Hello, world!")

And it should be changed to:
    print("Hello, human!")
