User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
To solve this, I'll:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python /tmp/gptme-evals-njeg7pjz/prime.py`

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Great! Let me break down the solution:

1. `is_prime(n)` efficiently checks if a number is prime by:
   - Returning False for numbers less than 2
   - Checking divisibility up to the square root of the number
   - This reduces unnecessary iterations

2. `find_nth_prime(n)` finds the nth prime by:
   - Incrementing a counter when a prime is found
   - Returning the prime when the nth prime is reached

3. The `main()` function specifically finds the 100th prime number
   - It prints 541, which is indeed the 100th prime number

The script is concise, efficient, and correctly solves the problem of finding the 100th prime number. Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
