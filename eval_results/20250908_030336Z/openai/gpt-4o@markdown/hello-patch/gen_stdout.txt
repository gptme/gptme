To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", I'll create a patch for you. 

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the current directory. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to ensure the file is present. 

Please execute the following commands:

```bash
pwd
ls
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
