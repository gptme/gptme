Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The file content is simple, and I can see the exact text that needs to be changed.

I see the patch failed because the file doesn't exist at the expected path. Let me try with just the filename since we're in the working directory context.
