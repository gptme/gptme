Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be because the file contents have changed since I last saw them, or because the patch was not correctly applied. To resolve this, I will re-read the file contents and try to apply the patch again.</thinking>

Let me re-read the file contents. 

```
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-ht459ujl/hello.py
```

Please execute this command so I can see the current contents of the file.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
