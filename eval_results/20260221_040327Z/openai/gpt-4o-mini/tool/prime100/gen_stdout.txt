User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it

It seems that I don't have permission to write directly to the `/app` directory. However, I can create the script in a subdirectory. Let's create the `prime.py` script in the `eval_results` directory instead. 

I'll proceed with that.
