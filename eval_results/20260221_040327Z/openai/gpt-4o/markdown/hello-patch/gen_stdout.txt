Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll create a patch for you. 

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Patch failed: No such file or directory

It seems there was an issue with applying the patch because the file `hello.py` does not exist in the current directory. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to ensure the file is present. 

I'll run the necessary commands to verify the file's existence.                                                                                [04:02:23] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
