User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let's start by initializing a git repository, creating a `main.py` file, and then committing it. I'll walk you through each step.

1. **Initialize a Git Repository**: We'll use `git init` to create a new git repository.
2. **Create `main.py`**: We'll write a simple Python script in `main.py`.
3. **Commit the File**: We'll add the file to the staging area and commit it.

Let's begin by initializing the git repository. 

```shell
git init
```                                                                                Initialized empty Git repository in /home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-02-21-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-4o-markdown-d94a623c/workspace/.git/
System: 
Ran command: `git init`

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The git repository has been initialized. Now, let's create the `main.py` file with a simple Python script.

```save /app/main.py
print("Hello, World!")
```
                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/main.py'
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems there is a permission issue when trying to create the `main.py` file in the `/app` directory. Let's first check the current working directory and then try to create the file in a location where we have write permissions. 

```shell
pwd
```                                                                                /home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-02-21-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-4o-markdown-d94a623c/workspace
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `pwd`

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It looks like the current working directory is `/home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-02-21-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-4o-markdown-d94a623c/workspace`. Let's create the `main.py` file in this directory instead.

```save /home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-02-21-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-4o-markdown-d94a623c/workspace/main.py
print("Hello, World!")
```                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to

The `main.py` file has been created successfully. Now, let's add this file to the staging area and commit it to the repository.

```shell
git add main.py
git commit -m "Add main.py with a simple hello world script"
```                                                                                [main (root-commit) 5915571] Add main.py with a simple hello world script
