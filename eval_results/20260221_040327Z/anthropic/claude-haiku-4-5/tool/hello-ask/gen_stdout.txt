The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print "Hello, <name>!" instead of just "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to modify the file. The current content is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Let me use the patch tool with conflict markers.
