Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple change.

I need to use the patch tool with:
- path: hello.py
- patch: using conflict markers to replace "Hello, world!" with "Hello, human!"

Let me create the patch:
```
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
</think>        </think>


@patch(toolu_01MJnLDFH6vJvpCV1q2kxPL3): {"path": "hello.py", "patch": "<<<<<<< ORIGINAL\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n=======\nprint(\"Hello, human!\")\n>>>>>>> UPDATED"}                                                                                System: ✅ Patch successfully applied to
