User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run it

I'll create a script that finds the 100th prime number and then execute it.

Let me write a simple but efficient prime number finder.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="prime.py">
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1
    return None

print(f"The 100th prime number is: {find_nth_prime(100)}")

Good, the file has been saved. Now I need to run it using the shell tool.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<shell>
python prime.py
</shell>
</tool-use>
                                                                                The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
Perfect! The script ran successfully and computed that the 100th prime number is 541. The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script computed and printed that the 100th prime number is **541**.                                                                                [04:02:53] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
