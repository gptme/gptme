Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple string replacement.

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

Great! The patch was successfully applied. The file hello.py now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". I should confirm this to the user.

Done! The code has been patched to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".                                                                                [04:02:47] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
