User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the required print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user asked me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've successfully created the file. The system confirmed that the file has been saved to hello.py. 

The task is complete. The user might want to run it next, but they haven't asked me to do that yet. I should just confirm that I've completed the task.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the code to print "Hello, world!". You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like.                                                                                [04:02:48] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 965 context | 0% cached
