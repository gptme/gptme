The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of the current "Hello, world!".

I need to use the patch tool to modify the file. The current content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
```
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Let me use the patch tool with the conflict markers.

It seems the working directory is not /app. Let me check the actual working directory first.
