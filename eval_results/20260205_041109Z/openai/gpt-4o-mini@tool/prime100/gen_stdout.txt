It seems that I don't have permission to write files directly in the `/app` directory. However, I can create the script in a subdirectory or a different location. 

Would you like me to create the `prime.py` script in the `eval_results` directory?                                                                                [04:10:20] Session: $0.00 | 3 turns | 2k context | 64% cached
