It seems there was an issue with the file path. Let's first check the current working directory to ensure we have the correct path to the `hello.py` file. Then, we can apply the patch. Let me check the current directory.                                                                                [04:10:05] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 971 context | 0% cached
