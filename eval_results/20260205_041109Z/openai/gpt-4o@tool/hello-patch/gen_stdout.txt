It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the `/app` directory. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to locate `hello.py`.

It seems there was an issue with locating the file `hello.py`. Let's list the files in the current directory to find the correct path. Could you please execute the following command to list the files?

```bash
ls -la /app
```                                                                                [04:10:08] Session: $0.02 | 3 turns | 1k context | 29% cached
