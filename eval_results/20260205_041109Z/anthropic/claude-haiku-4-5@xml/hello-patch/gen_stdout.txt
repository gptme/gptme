The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is straightforward - I need to modify the print statement.

Let me use the patch tool to make this change.

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
