User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the required print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been successfully saved. The user asked me to write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed it was saved. I should acknowledge this completion concisely since the user prefers not to have basic concepts explained.
</think>        </think>

Done! The file `hello.py` has been created with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [04:10:20] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 965 context | 0% cached
