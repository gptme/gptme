User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Run the script

I'll create a simple prime number generator that finds the 100th prime number and prints it.

Let me write a script that:
- Has a function to check if a number is prime
- Iterates through numbers, counting primes until we reach 100
- Prints the 100th prime

Then I'll execute it.

        return False

Now I need to run the script to show the output.

`541`

Great! The script ran successfully and printed 541, which is the 100th prime number. The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script computed and printed the 100th prime number: **541**                                                                                [04:10:24] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
