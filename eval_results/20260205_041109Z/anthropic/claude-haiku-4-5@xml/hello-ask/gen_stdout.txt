The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. I should use the patch tool to make this change.

Current content:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Updated content should:
1. Ask for the user's name
2. Store it in a variable
3. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I'll use the patch tool to modify this.

The patch has been successfully applied. The user's hello.py file has been modified to ask for their name and print a personalized greeting. The task is complete.

Done! I've updated `hello.py` to ask for the user's name and greet them with a personalized message. The script will now:
1. Prompt the user with "What is your name? "
2. Print "Hello, {name}!" with their input                                                                                [04:10:21] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
