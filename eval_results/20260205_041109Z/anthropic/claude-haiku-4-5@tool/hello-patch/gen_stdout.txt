Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a straightforward patch task.

I need to use the patch tool to modify the file. The file currently contains:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And I need to change it to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

I'll use the patch tool with the conflict markers format.
