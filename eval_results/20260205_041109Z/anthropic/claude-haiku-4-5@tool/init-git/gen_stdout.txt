User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I'll do this step by step:
1. First, initialize the git repo with `git init`
2. Then create a main.py file with some basic content
3. Configure git user (needed for commits)
4. Add the file and commit it

Let me do this using the shell and save tools.
