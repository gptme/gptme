User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Create a script called `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll write a Python script that finds the 100th prime number. Here's my approach:
- Create a function to check if a number is prime
- Loop through numbers until we find 100 primes
- Print the result

Let me write and save the script, then run it.
