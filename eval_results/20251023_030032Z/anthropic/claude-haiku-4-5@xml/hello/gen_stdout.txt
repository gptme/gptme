The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create hello.py with the appropriate print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: âœ… Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user now has a hello.py script that prints "Hello, world!". I should confirm this is done and let them know they can run it if they want.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created and will print "Hello, world!" when executed.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
