User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call the script

I'll write a script that finds the 100th prime number. I can use a simple algorithm to check for primes.

Let me create a script with a function to check if a number is prime, then iterate until we find the 100th prime.

Perfect! The script worked correctly. It computed the 100th prime number which is 541 and printed it. The task is complete.

Done! The script computes and prints that the 100th prime number is **541**.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
