The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print "Hello, <name>!". 

I should use the patch tool to modify the file. Currently it just prints "Hello, world!", and I need to change it to ask for input and use that input in the greeting.

Let me apply a patch:
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

+name = input("What is your name? ")

Great! The patch was successfully applied. The user's hello.py file has been modified to:
1. Ask for the user's name with `input()`
2. Print a greeting with the provided name

The modification is complete and the system confirmed the patch was applied.
</think>        </think>

Done! The file has been modified to ask for the user's name and greet them with it.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
