<thinking>          <thinking>
1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file to add user input functionality
2. I can use the patch tool since we have the original content and want to make a specific change
3. The change is simple: replace the static print with input and formatted print

I've modified the hello.py file to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Store it in a variable called 'name'
3. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string with the exact format requested: 'Hello, <name>!'

You can now run the script and it will interactively ask for a name before printing the greeting.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
