Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The change is simple and straightforward.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

The patch has been applied successfully. The code will now print "Hello, human!" when executed. Would you like me to do anything else with the code?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
