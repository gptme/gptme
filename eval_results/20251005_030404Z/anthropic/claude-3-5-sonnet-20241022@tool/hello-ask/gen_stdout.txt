<thinking>          <thinking>
1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file to add user input functionality
2. I can use the patch tool since we have the original content and want to make a specific change
3. The change is simple: replace the print statement with input and formatted print

I've modified hello.py to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string
3. Used single quotes for 'Hello' as specified in your request

The program will now ask for a name and print "Hello, <name>!" with the actual name entered by the user.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
