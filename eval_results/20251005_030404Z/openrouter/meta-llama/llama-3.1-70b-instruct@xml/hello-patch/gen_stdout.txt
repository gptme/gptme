Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the fact that the file contents were not exactly as I expected. Let me try again by reading the current file contents and creating a new patch.</thinking>

First, I will read the current contents of the file using the `cat` command.

```
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-xmiiv1c8/hello.py
```

Please execute this command so I can see the current contents of the file.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
