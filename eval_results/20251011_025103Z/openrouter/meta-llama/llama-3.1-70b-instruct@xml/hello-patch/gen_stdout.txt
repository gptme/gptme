Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the fact that the file contents were not exactly as I expected.

To resolve this, I will re-read the file contents and try to patch it again.
</thinking>           </thinking>

Let me re-read the file contents. 

```
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-uac5rkew/hello.py
```

Please execute the above command so that I can see the current file contents.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
