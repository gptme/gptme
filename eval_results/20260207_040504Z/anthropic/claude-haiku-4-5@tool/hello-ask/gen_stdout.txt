The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of just printing "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to make this change, since the file already exists and I need to modify it.

The original content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

The new content should be:
```
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Let me use the patch tool with the conflict markers format.
