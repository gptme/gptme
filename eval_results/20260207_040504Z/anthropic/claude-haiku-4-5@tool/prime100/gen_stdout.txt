User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/execute the script

I'll create a Python script that finds the 100th prime number. I can use a simple algorithm to check if a number is prime and count up to the 100th one.

Let me write the script and then execute it.
