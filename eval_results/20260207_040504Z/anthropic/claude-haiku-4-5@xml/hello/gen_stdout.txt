The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user can now run it if they want. I should let them know it's ready.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` is ready. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [04:04:12] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
