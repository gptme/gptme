It seems that I don't have permission to create or modify files in the `/app` directory. Let's check the permissions of the current directory to understand the issue better. I'll do that now.

The `/app` directory has restricted permissions, which is likely why I can't create or modify files there. 

To proceed, I can either:
1. Attempt to create the script in a different directory where I have write permissions.
2. If you have a specific directory in mind where I can create the script, please let me know.

Which option would you prefer?                                                                                [04:04:12] Session: $0.00 | 4 turns | 2k context | 47% cached
