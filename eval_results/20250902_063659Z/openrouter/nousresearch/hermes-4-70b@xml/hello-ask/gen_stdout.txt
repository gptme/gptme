The code has been modified to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. Here's the updated code:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

When you run this script, it will prompt the user to enter their name, then display a greeting using the provided name.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
