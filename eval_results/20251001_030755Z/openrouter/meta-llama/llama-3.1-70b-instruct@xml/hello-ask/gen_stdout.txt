<thinking>Let's use the patch tool to modify the existing hello.py file. We'll replace the print statement with a new one that asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting.</thinking>

System: ❌ 
Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This might be because the file contents have changed since we last read it. Let's re-read the file and try again.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<shell>
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-f8jf5viz/hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                print("Hello, human!")System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat /tmp/gptme-evals-f8jf5viz/hello.py`

<thinking>Now that we have the current contents of the file, we can try patching it again. This time, we'll make sure to patch the correct original chunk.</thinking>
