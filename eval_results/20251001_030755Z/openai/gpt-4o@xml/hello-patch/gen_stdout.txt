Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll create a patch for you.

<tool-use>
<patch args='/tmp/gptme-evals-_yb1aih1/hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>

It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the expected location. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to locate `hello.py`. 

<tool-use>
<terminal>
pwd
ls -la /tmp/gptme-evals-_yb1aih1
</terminal>
</tool-use>                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
