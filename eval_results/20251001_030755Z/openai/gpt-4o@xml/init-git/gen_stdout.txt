Let's start by initializing a git repository, creating a `main.py` file, and then committing it. Here are the steps:

1. Initialize a git repository.
2. Create a `main.py` file with some content.
3. Add the file to the git staging area.
4. Commit the file to the repository.

Let's execute these steps.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
