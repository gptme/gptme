Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll help you patch the `hello.py` file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

System: âœ… Patch successfully applied to `hello.py`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Great! The patch was successfully applied. The `hello.py` file now contains the updated line printing "Hello, human!" instead of the original "Hello, world!" message. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this file or any other tasks you have in mind?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
