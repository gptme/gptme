Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, we can update the script as follows:

1. Use the `input()` function to prompt the user for their name.
2. Use an f-string to format the greeting message.

Let's apply this change.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
