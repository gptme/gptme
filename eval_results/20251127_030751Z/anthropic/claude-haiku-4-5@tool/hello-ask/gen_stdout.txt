The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print "Hello, <name>!" instead of just "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to make this modification. Let me create a patch that:
1. Removes the print statement that says "Hello, world!"
2. Adds an input statement to ask for the user's name
3. Adds a print statement that uses the name

Here's the patch:
