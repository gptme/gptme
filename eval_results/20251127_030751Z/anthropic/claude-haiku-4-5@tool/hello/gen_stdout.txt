The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I need to use the save tool to create a file called hello.py with the appropriate content.

@save(toolu_01R2mGMAawvGiBXLR5jp5YYC): {"path": "hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")"}

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

Done! The script is saved as `hello.py` and will print "Hello, world!" when executed.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
