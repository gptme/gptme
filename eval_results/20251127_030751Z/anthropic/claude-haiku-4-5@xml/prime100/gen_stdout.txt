User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll create a script with a simple prime checking algorithm. Let me write it first, then execute it.

I need to:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Find the 100th prime number
3. Print it
4. Run the script

Let me write a straightforward approach:
- Check each number starting from 2
- Count prime numbers until we reach 100
- Print that prime

The `save` tool to create the file, then `shell` tool to run it.
