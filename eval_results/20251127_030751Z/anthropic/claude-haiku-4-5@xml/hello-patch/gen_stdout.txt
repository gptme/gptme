The user wants me to patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple patch task.

I need to:
1. Use the patch tool to modify hello.py
2. Change "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"
</think>        </think>

<function_calls>
<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
