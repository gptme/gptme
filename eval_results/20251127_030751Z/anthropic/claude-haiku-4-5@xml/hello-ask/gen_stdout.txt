The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with it. I have the original content shown:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change this to:
1. Ask for the user's name using `input()`
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.
