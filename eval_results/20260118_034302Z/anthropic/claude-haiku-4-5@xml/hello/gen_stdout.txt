The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>

<function_calls>
<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

The file has been successfully saved. The user's request is complete. I should let them know it's ready and offer to help with anything else if needed.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [03:42:10] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 970 context | 0% cached
