The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print "Hello, <name>!" instead of "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to make this modification. Let me update the file to:
1. Ask for the user's name with input()
2. Print a greeting with the name

Since the file is small and only one line needs to be changed, I'll use the patch tool.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

The patch was successfully applied! The file has been modified to ask for the user's name and then print a greeting with that name.

The user's request has been completed successfully. I should confirm this to the user.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've updated `hello.py` to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. The script will now:

1. Prompt the user with "What is your name? "
2. Print "Hello, {name}!" with their input

You can test it by running: `python hello.py`                                                                                [03:42:15] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
