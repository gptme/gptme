Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple patch.

I should use the patch tool to modify the file. The original code is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And I need to change it to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>
