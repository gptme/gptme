<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and then print a greeting with that name. I need to use the patch tool to modify the file.

The original code is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print "Hello, <name>!" using the provided name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
