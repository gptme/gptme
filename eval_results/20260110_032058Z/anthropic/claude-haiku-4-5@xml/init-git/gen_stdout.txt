User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it

The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

Let me do these steps in order using the shell tool.

There's a permission denied error when trying to create .git in /app. Let me try checking if the directory exists and what permissions it has.

The /app directory is owned by root with 755 permissions, so I can't write to it directly. Let me create a new directory where I have write permissions. I could use a subdirectory or check if I can write to /tmp or another location. Let me try creating a new directory in /app or use a different approach.

Actually, let me try to use the current working directory. Let me check what my actual permissions are by trying to write a test file.

I'm in /app but I don't have write permissions since it's owned by root. Let me try creating a subdirectory or project folder where I can work. Let me try mkdir to create a new project directory.

Great! Git repository is initialized. Now I need to:
1. Write a main.py file
2. Commit it

Let me save the main.py file and then commit it.

<tool-use>
<save args="/tmp/my_project/main.py">
print("Hello, World!")
</save>

Now I need to commit the file. First I should add it, then commit it. I also need to configure git user name and email for the commit.

Perfect! I've successfully:
1. Initialized a git repository in /tmp/my_project
2. Written a main.py file with a simple print statement
3. Committed it with the message "Initial commit: add main.py"

The commit shows:
- [main (root-commit) 70bde4b] - the commit hash and it's the root commit on main branch
- 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) - confirming main.py was added
- create mode 100644 main.py - the file was created with standard permissions

Everything is done!
</think>        </think>

Done! I've:
1. Initialized a git repository in `/tmp/my_project`
2. Created `main.py` with a simple print statement
3. Committed it with the message "Initial commit: add main.py"

The commit hash is `70bde4b` and the working directory is now `/tmp/my_project`.                                                                                [03:20:54] Session: $0.01 | 5 turns | 3k context | 0% cached
