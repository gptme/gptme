The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the required content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")

The file has been successfully saved. The user asked for a script to print "Hello, world!" and it's now created. I should confirm this is done and offer to help them run it if they want.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created and will print "Hello, world!" when you run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:20:37] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
