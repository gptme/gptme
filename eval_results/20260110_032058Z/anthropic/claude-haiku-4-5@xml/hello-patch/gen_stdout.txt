Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple patch task.

I need to use the patch tool to change:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```
to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

Let me apply the patch:

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>
