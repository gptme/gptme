User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call the script to run it

I'll create a simple script that finds prime numbers and prints the 100th one. I can use a basic primality test for this.

Let me write the script and then execute it.
