<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of 'Hello, world!'.

I can use the patch tool to make this modification. The current content is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

And I need to change it to:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Let me apply a patch to this file.
