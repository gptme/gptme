User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the file hello.py with the appropriate content.

I got a permission denied error. Let me try saving to the current directory without specifying /app, or maybe try with a relative path. Let me use just "hello.py" which should work in the current directory.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the content `print("Hello, world!")`. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:20:38] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
