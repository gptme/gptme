<thinking>It seems that the file `hello.py` is not located in the `/app` directory. I should check the current working directory and list the files to find the correct location of `hello.py`.</thinking>

Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to locate `hello.py`. Could you please execute the following commands?

```bash
pwd
ls -la
```                                                                                [03:20:24] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 937 context | 0% cached
