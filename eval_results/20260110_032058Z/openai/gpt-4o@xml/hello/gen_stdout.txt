It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from saving the file in the `/app` directory. 

Could you please check the permissions of the directory or let me know if there's another directory where I can save the file?                                                                                [03:20:28] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 802 context | 0% cached
