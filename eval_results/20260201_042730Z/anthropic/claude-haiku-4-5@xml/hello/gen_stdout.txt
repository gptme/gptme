User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed it was saved to hello.py. I could offer to run it to verify it works, but the user just asked me to write it, which is now done. I'll keep my response brief and professional.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the content:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like to test it.                                                                                [04:26:27] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
