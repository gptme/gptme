Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a straightforward patch.

I need to use the patch tool to modify the file. The original line is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And it should become:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

Let me create the patch with the conflict markers.

Done! The code now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".                                                                                [04:26:27] Session: $0.00 | 2 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
