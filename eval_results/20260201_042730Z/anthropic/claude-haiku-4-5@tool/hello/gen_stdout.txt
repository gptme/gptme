The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with that content.

@save(toolu_01RMCbyYxYrdvEDN5eyByqkt): {"path": "/app/hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")"}                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let me try with a relative path instead:
@save(toolu_01NXNA5sZzgjo5pUraujtzck): {"path": "hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")"}                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Done! I've created `hello.py` with the content that prints "Hello, world!". You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [04:26:27] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
