User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll write a Python script that finds the 100th prime number. I'll use a simple approach - check each number to see if it's prime by testing divisibility.

Let me create the script and then run it.

Hmm, there's a permission issue. Let me try using the shell command to write the file instead.

Ah, the current directory is different from /app. Let me save the file to the current working directory instead.
