Here's a patch to modify `hello.py` to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: ✅ Patch successfully applied to

The `hello.py` file has been updated to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. If you run the script, it will now prompt for the user's name and respond with "Hello, \<name\>!".                                                                                [04:26:13] Session: $0.02 | 2 turns | 2k context | 50% cached
