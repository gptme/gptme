User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll break this down into steps:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Create a function to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run

`541`

<thinking>          <thinking>
The script successfully computed the 100th prime number, which is 541.

Let me break down how the script works:
1. `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
3. When run directly, it prints the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

The 100th prime number is 541. The script worked correctly and efficiently. Would you like me to explain the algorithm in more detail or modify the script in any way?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
