I'll modify the hello.py file to ask for the user's name using the patch tool:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

The file has been updated successfully. You can now run the script and it will ask for your name before greeting you. Would you like me to help you with anything else?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
