To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, I'll update the script accordingly. Here's the patch:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```                                                                                [03:25:21] Session: $0.01 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
