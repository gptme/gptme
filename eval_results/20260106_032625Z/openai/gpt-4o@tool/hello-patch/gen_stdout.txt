It seems there was an issue with locating the file `hello.py`. Let's list the files in the current directory to find the correct path. Could you please run the following command to list the files?

```bash
ls -la /app
```                                                                                [03:25:22] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 1k context | 61% cached
