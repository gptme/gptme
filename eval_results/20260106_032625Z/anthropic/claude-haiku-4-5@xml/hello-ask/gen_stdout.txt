The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of just "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to make this change. Let me patch the file to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print a greeting with that name

Here's the change I need to make:
- Replace `print("Hello, world!")` with code that asks for the name and prints the greeting

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
