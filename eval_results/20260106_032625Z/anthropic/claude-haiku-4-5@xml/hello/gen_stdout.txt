User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with a print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed it was saved to hello.py. I should confirm this is complete and let them know they can run it if they want.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:25:33] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
