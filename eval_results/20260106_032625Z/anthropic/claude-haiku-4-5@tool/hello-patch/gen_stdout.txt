Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". I need to use the patch tool to modify the print statement.

It seems the working directory is different from what I expected. The system info said `/app` but the actual working directory is `/home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-01-06-gptme-evals-anthropic--claude-haiku-4-5-tool-f9b52829/workspace`. I need to create the hello.py file first in the correct location.

Actually, looking at the user's code block, they're showing me the content of hello.py. Let me try creating the file first or using the absolute path that was shown in the error.
</thinking>           </thinking>

Let me first check the current working directory and create the file:
