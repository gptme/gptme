<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of the current "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to make this modification. Let me create a patch that:
1. Gets the user's input for their name
2. Prints a personalized greeting

The current code is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

It should become something like:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

I'll use the patch tool with git conflict markers.

Done! I've modified hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.
