To write a script that computes and prints the 100th prime number, we need to:
1. Define a function to check if a number is prime.
2. Use this function to find the 100th prime number.
3. Print the result.
</thinking>           </thinking>

Here's how we can do it:

```python
# prime.py

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(nth_prime(100))
```

Now, let's call the script:

```shell
python prime.py
```

This will print the 100th prime number.                                                                                [03:25:42] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
