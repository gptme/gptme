User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it

<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

Let me do this step by step:
1. Initialize git with `git init`
2. Create a main.py file with some basic content
3. Add it to git and commit

I should check the current working directory first, then do these operations.
