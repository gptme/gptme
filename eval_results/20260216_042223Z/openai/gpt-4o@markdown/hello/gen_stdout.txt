It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from writing to the `/app` directory. You can try running the command with elevated permissions or change the permissions of the directory. Alternatively, I can guide you on how to create the file manually. Would you like to proceed with any of these options?                                                                                [04:21:20] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 790 context | 0% cached
