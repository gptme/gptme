To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, we can use the `input` function to get the user's name and then format the output string. Here's the updated code:

```save hello.py
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py (overwritten)

The `hello.py` script has been updated to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. If you run the script, it will prompt you for your name and then greet you with "Hello, \<name\>!".                                                                                [04:21:20] Session: $0.02 | 2 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
