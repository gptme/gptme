Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The file content is simple, and I can see the exact text that needs to be changed.

I see the patch failed because the file doesn't exist at the specified path. Let me check if the file is in the current directory with the correct path.
The error shows we're in a different working directory than expected. I should use the exact path where the file exists.
