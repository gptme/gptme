Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py

To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", I'll create a patch for you.

<tool-use>
<patch args='/tmp/gptme-evals-spt90mha/hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")

It seems there was an issue with applying the patch. Let's first check the contents of the `hello.py` file to ensure we have the correct context. I'll display the contents of the file.                                                                                [02:53:26] Auto-reply: Assistant message had no tools. Asking for

Let's try displaying the contents of the `hello.py` file to verify its current state. I'll use the `cat` command to do this.

```bash
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-spt90mha/hello.py
```                                                                                [02:53:27] Autonomous mode: No tools used after confirmation. Exiting.
