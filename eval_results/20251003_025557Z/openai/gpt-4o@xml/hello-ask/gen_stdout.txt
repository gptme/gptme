User:

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

To modify `hello.py` to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, we can use the `input` function to get the user's name and then print the greeting. Let's apply this change.                                                                                [02:53:25] Auto-reply: Assistant message had no tools. Asking for

User: Are you sure? If you're finished, use the `complete` tool to end the 
session.

I apologize for the oversight. Let's apply the necessary changes to `hello.py` to achieve the desired functionality.                                                                                [02:53:27] Autonomous mode: No tools used after confirmation. Exiting.
