The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create hello.py with the appropriate print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed the file was saved to hello.py. I should acknowledge this is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a print statement that outputs "Hello, world!".                                                                                [04:23:45] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 963 context | 0% cached
