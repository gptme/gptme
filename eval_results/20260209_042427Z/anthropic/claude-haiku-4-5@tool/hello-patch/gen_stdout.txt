The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a straightforward patch task.

I need to use the patch tool to:
1. Find the original line: `print("Hello, world!")`
2. Replace it with: `print("Hello, human!")`

Let me create a patch for this.
