User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run that script

I'll create a Python script that finds the 100th prime number. Let me write an efficient prime checking function and then find the 100th prime.

I'll use a simple but effective approach:
- Start with candidate numbers starting from 2
- For each candidate, check if it's prime
- Count the primes until we reach 100
- Print the 100th prime

Let me create the script and then run it.
