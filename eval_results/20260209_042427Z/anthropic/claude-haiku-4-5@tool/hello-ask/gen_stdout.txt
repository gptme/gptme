<think>       <think>
The user wants me to modify the hello.py file to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. I have the current content of the file, so I can use the patch tool to make the modification.

Current content:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask for the user's name with input()
2. Print a greeting with their name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
