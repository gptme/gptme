User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To compute and print the 100th prime number, we can use a simple algorithm to check for prime numbers and count them until we reach the 100th one. Let's write the script `prime.py`.                                                                                [04:23:36] Session: $0.01 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
