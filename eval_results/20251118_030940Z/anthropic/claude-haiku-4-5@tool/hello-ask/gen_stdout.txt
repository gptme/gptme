The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name instead of printing a static greeting. I need to:
1. Read input from the user for their name
2. Print a greeting with that name

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.

Done! The script now asks for the user's name and greets them personally.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
