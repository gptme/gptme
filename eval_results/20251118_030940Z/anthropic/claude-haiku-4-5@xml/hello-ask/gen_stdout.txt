The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of just printing "Hello, world!".

I need to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print a greeting with the name

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file.

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
