<think>       <think>
The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:
<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user's simple request is complete. I should confirm it's done and maybe offer to run it if they want to verify.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script is ready. You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like to verify it works.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
