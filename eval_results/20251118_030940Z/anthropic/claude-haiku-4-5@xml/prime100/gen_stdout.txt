User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

Let me write a simple script that finds the 100th prime number. I'll use a straightforward approach to check for primes.

Then I'll execute it using the shell tool.

<tool-use>
<save args='prime.py'>
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
num = 2
while count < 100:
    if is_prime(num):
        count += 1
        if count == 100:
            print(f"The 100th prime number is: {num}")
            break
    num += 1
</save>

System: ✅ Saved to prime.py

Good, the file was saved. Now I need to call/run it using the shell tool.

python prime.py

The 100th prime number is: 541
System:
Ran command: `python prime.py`

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

Perfect! The script ran successfully and computed that the 100th prime number is 541. The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script computed that the 100th prime number is **541**.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
