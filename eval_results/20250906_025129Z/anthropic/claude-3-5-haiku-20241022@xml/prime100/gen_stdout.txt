User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
To solve this, I'll:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The script successfully ran and found the 100th prime number, which is 541. 
This confirms that our implementation of finding the nth prime number works correctly.

Let me break down the key components of the script:
1. `is_prime()` efficiently checks primality by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number
2. `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
3. `main()` calls `find_nth_prime(100)` and prints the result
</thinking>           </thinking>

The script is concise, readable, and solves the task of finding the 100th prime number. Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
