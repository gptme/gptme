Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch the code in hello.py to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I need to use the patch tool to modify the file. The user has provided the content directly, but I should still apply a patch to change "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

Let me create a patch that replaces "world" with "human".
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

The patch was successfully applied. The user asked me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", and the system confirmed the patch was applied successfully to the file.

I should confirm that the task is complete. Since the user prefers concise responses and doesn't want explanations of basic concepts, I should keep it brief.

Done! Changed the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"                                                                                [03:26:25] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
