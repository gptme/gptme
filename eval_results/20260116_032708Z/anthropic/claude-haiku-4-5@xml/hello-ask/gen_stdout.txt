The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and then print a greeting with that name. I need to:

1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Store that input
3. Print a greeting with their name in the format 'Hello, <name>!'

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification to the existing file.

Done! The file now prompts the user for their name and greets them with it.                                                                                [03:26:26] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
