<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print "Hello, <name>!". 

I can see the current content of hello.py is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print "Hello, <name>!" with the provided name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

Done! The script now asks for the user's name and prints "Hello, <name>!". You can test it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [03:26:25] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 3k context | 0% cached
