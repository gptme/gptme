It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from writing to the `/app` directory. You can try running the command with elevated permissions or change the permissions of the directory. Alternatively, you can specify a different directory where you have write access. Let me know how you would like to proceed!                                                                                [03:26:11] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 790 context | 0% cached
