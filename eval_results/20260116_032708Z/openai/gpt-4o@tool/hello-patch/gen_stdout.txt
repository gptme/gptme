It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the current directory. Let's first check the contents of the current directory to see if the file is located elsewhere or if it needs to be created.

It seems there was an issue with locating the file `hello.py`. Let's list the files in the current directory to verify its existence or determine if it needs to be created. Could you please provide the output of the `ls` command in the `/app` directory?                                                                                [03:26:13] Session: $0.02 | 3 turns | 1k context | 61% cached
