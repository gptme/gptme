Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

I need to use the patch tool to modify the file. The current content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

Let me use the patch tool to make this change.

<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
