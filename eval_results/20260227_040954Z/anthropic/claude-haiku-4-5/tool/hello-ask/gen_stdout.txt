The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. 

I have the current content of hello.py:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' with the name they provided

I can use the patch tool to make this change.
