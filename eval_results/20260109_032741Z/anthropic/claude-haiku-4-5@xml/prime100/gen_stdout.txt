User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

Let me write a simple prime number finder that gets the 100th prime.

I'll create a script that:
- Has a function to check if a number is prime
- Finds primes until we have 100 of them
- Prints the 100th prime

Let me write this script and then run it.
