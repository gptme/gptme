The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". I should use the save tool to create the file hello.py with the appropriate content.

It seems I don't have write permissions to /app. Let me try with a relative path instead, which should work in the current working directory.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the content that prints "Hello, world!". You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:26:49] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
