The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. I have the current content of the file shown in the code block, so I can use the patch tool to make this change.

Current content:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

New content should:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!'

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.
