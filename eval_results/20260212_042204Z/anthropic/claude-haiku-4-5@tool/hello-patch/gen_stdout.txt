Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<think>       <think>
The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple string substitution.

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
