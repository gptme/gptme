User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call the script

I'll write a Python script that finds the 100th prime number. I can use a simple approach to check if numbers are prime.

Let me create the script and then execute it.

There's a permission denied error. Let me check the current working directory and permissions. I should use pwd to see where I am, and then try to save the file with proper permissions.
