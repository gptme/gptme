User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been successfully saved. The user's task is complete. I should acknowledge this and confirm that the script is ready. I could offer to run it if they'd like, but they haven't asked for that yet.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py` whenever you're ready.                                                                                [04:21:04] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
