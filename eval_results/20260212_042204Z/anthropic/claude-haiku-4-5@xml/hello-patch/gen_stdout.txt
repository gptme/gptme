The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

This is a simple change. I need to use the patch tool to update the print statement.

Let me apply the patch:

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ✅ Patch successfully applied to
