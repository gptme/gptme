It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the current directory. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to ensure the file is present. Could you please provide the correct path or create the file if it doesn't exist?                                                                                [04:20:49] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 937 context | 0% cached
