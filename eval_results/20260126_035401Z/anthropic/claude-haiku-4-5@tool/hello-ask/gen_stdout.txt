<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. I have the current content of the file:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print a greeting with their name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
