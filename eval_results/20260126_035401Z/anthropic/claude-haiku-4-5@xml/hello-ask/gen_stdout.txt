The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print "Hello, <name>!" instead of just "Hello, world!".

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file. The original content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print a greeting with that name

Let me use the patch tool to make this change.

<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
