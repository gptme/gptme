Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

It seems there was an issue with the patch format. Let me correct that. I'll try again. 

<tool-use>
<patch args="/app/hello.py">
<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Invalid patch: invalid patch, no `<<<<<<<

It seems there is a persistent issue with applying the patch. Let me try a different approach by rewriting the entire file. 

<tool-use>
<save file="/app/hello.py">
print("Hello, human!")
</save>
</tool-use>                                                                                [03:52:54] Session: $0.02 | 3 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
