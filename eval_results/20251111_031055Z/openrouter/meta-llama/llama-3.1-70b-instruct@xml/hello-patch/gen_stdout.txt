Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems like the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the fact that the file contents were not exactly as I expected. Let me try to read the file and see what's actually in there.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<exec args='cat /tmp/gptme-evals-qyc1xnnu/hello.py'>
</exec>
