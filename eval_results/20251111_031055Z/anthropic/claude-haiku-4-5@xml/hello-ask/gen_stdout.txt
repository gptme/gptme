<think>       <think>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of the current "Hello, world!".

I need to:
1. Ask for input from the user
2. Store the name
3. Print a greeting with the name

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.

<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
