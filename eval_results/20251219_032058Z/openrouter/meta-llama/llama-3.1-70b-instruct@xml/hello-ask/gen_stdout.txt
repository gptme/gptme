System: ❌ 
Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file

<thinking>It seems like the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the file contents being different from what I expected. Let me try to read the file again and see what's going on.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<shell>
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-9aw0qu5i/hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")System:

<thinking>It seems like the file already contains the code to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. In that case, no modification is needed.</thinking>                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
