<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of just "Hello, world!".

I can use the patch tool to make this modification. Let me update the file to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print a greeting with that name

I'll use the patch tool since the file is small and straightforward.
