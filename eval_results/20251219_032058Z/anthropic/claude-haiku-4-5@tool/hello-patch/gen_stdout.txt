Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a straightforward string replacement.

I'll use the patch tool with the exact text that needs to be changed.
