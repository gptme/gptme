The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. I need to patch the file to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print a greeting with the name in the format 'Hello, <name>!'

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

The patch was successfully applied. The user's hello.py file has been modified to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've modified hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. The script will now prompt the user to enter their name and display "Hello, <name>!" accordingly.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
