Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I need to use the patch tool to change the string in the print statement.

Let me apply the patch:

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>
