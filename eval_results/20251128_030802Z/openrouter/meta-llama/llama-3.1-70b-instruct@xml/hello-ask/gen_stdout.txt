<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This might be because the file contents have changed since we last checked. Let's try to get the current contents of the file and create a new patch.</thinking>

<shell>
cat hello.py

<thinking>Now that we have the current contents of the file, let's create a new patch to modify the hello.py file. We'll replace the existing print statement with a new one that asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting.</thinking>

<thinking>It seems that the patch failed again. This time, let's try to patch the entire file, not just the print statement. We'll use the patch tool to replace the entire contents of the file with the new code.</thinking>

<thinking>It seems that the patch tool is not working as expected. Let's try a different approach. We can use the save tool to overwrite the entire file with the new code.</thinking>

name = input("What is your name? ")
