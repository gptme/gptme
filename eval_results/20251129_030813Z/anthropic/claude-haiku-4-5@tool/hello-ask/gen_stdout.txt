<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. I have the current content of hello.py which is:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to ask for the user's name and then print a greeting with that name. I can use the patch tool to do this, or the save tool to rewrite it.

Since this is a simple change, I'll use the patch tool to modify the file.
