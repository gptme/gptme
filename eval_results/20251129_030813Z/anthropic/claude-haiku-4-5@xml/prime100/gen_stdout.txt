User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/execute that script

Let me create a script that finds the 100th prime number. I'll use a simple algorithm to check if numbers are prime and count until I reach the 100th one.

Here's my approach:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Loop through numbers, counting primes until we reach 100
3. Print the 100th prime

Let me write this script and then execute it.

Perfect! The script ran successfully and computed that the 100th prime number is 541. The user's request has been completed - I've written the prime.py script and executed it.

Done! The script computed and printed the 100th prime number: **541**                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
