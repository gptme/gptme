User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The save tool confirmed it was saved to hello.py. The task is complete.

Since the user is a curious programmer, they might want to run it next, but they didn't ask me to do that. I'll keep my response brief and professional.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created and will print "Hello, world!" when executed.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
