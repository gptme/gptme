Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll create a patch for you.

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

It seems there was an issue with applying the patch because the file `hello.py` could not be found. Let's first check the current working directory to ensure we're in the right place, and then list the files to verify the presence of `hello.py`. 

Please execute the following commands:

```bash
pwd
ls
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
