Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The file content and desired change are both clear, so I can proceed with the patch.

The patch failed because the content in the file might be different from what was shown. Let me try with double quotes since Python accepts both single and double quotes.

I apologize, but I seem to be having trouble applying the patch. Could you please confirm the exact content of the hello.py file? This will help me create the correct patch. You can share the current content of the file, and I'll make sure to match it exactly in the patch.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
