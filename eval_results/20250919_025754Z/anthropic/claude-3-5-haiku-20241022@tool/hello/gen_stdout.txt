I'll use the `save` tool to create the Python script.
@save(toolu_0121ojU4j3Cm5E3tYDHYLy1S): {"path": "hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")"}

I've created a simple Python script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!" when executed. The script is now saved in the current directory (/tmp/gptme-evals-rhbh_01e). 

Would you like me to run the script or do anything else with it?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
