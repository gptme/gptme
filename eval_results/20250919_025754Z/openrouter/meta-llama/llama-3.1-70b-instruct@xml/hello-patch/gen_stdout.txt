Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file

It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the fact that the file contents were not exactly as expected.

Let me try again, but this time I will make sure to get the exact file contents before applying the patch.

Can you please run the command `cat /tmp/gptme-evals-847h_y_x/hello.py` so I can see the exact contents of the file?
