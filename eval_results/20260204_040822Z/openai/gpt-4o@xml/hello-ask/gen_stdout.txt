To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, I'll update the script accordingly. Here's the patch:

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Invalid patch: invalid patch, no `<<<<<<<

It seems there was an issue with the patch format. Let me correct that and provide the updated script.

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
</save>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py (overwritten)

The `hello.py` script has been updated to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. If you run the script now, it will prompt for the user's name and greet them accordingly.                                                                                [04:07:56] Session: $0.03 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
