Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user has confirmed that the file was saved. The task is complete. I should acknowledge this and let them know the script is ready to use if they want to run it.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script is saved to `hello.py`. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [04:08:02] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
