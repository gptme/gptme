The patch was successfully applied! The user asked me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", and the system confirmed that the patch was applied successfully to the file.

The task is complete. I don't need to do anything else since the patch has been applied.
</think>        </think>

Done! The file has been patched to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".                                                                                [04:08:02] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
