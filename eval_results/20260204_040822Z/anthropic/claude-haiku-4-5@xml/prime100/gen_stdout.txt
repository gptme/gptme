User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll create a script that efficiently finds the 100th prime number. I can use a simple sieve approach or trial division. Let me create a straightforward solution using trial division with optimization.

Let me write the script first, then execute it.
