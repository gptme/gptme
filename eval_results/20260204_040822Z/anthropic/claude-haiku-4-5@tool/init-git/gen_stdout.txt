User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it

The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I'll need to:
1. Use `git init` to initialize a repository
2. Use the `save` tool to create main.py with some basic content
3. Use `git add` and `git commit` to commit the file

Let me do these step by step. First, let me check the current working directory to confirm we're in /app.
