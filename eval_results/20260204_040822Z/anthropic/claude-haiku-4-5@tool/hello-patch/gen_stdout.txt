Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

I need to:
1. Keep the original print statement
2. Change it to print "Hello, human!" instead

Let me use the patch tool with the conflict markers format.
