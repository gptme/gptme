User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a file called hello.py with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>

<function_calls>
<invoke name="save">
<parameter name="args">hello.py</parameter>
print("Hello, world!")
</invoke>
</function_calls>
                                                                                System: No content provided
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The save tool didn't provide feedback. Let me try again with the proper format. I need to create a hello.py file with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                
Preview
print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: âœ… Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
Great! The file has been saved successfully. The user's script is now created at hello.py with the content "print("Hello, world!")" which will print "Hello, world!" when executed.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
