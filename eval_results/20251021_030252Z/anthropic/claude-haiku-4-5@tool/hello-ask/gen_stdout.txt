<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of the current "Hello, world!" message.

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file with minimal changes.

Done! I've modified hello.py to ask for the user's name and greet them personalized greeting. The script now:
1. Prompts the user for their name
2. Prints "Hello, <name>!"                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
