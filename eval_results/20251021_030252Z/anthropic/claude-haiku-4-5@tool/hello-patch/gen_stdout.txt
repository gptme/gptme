Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

I need to:
1. Use the patch tool
2. Specify the path as "hello.py"
3. Use conflict markers to show the change from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"
