User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I just need to use the save tool to create a file called hello.py with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been successfully saved. The user asked me to write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!" and I've completed that task. The system confirmed it was saved to hello.py.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!". You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [04:18:43] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 967 context | 0% cached
