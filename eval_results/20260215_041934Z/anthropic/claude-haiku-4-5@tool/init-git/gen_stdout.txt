<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

Let me do this step by step:
1. First, I'll initialize git
2. Then create a main.py file
3. Then commit it

I should check what directory I'm in first to make sure I'm in the right place.
</think>        </think>

I'll help you initialize a git repository, create a main.py file, and commit it. Let me do this step by step.
