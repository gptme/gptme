The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. 

The current file contains:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!'

I can use the patch tool to modify this file. Let me create a patch that replaces the print statement with an input statement and a formatted print statement.
