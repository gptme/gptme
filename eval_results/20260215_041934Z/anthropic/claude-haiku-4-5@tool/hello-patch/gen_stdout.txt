The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. The file is in the current working directory /app, so the path should be /app/hello.py.

The change is simple:
- ORIGINAL: print("Hello, world!")
- UPDATED: print("Hello, human!")
</think>        </think>
