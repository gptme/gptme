To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, we can update the script as follows:

1. Use the `input()` function to prompt the user for their name.
2. Use an f-string to format the greeting message.

Let's apply these changes to the script.                                                                                [04:18:35] Session: $0.01 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
