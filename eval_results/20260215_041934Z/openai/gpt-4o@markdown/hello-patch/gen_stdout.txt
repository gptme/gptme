Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll create a patch for you.

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Patch failed: No such file or directory

It seems there was an issue with the patch tool due to a missing file. Let's first check the current working directory to ensure we're in the right place, and then verify the existence of `hello.py`. After that, we can apply the patch. 

Let's start by listing the files in the current directory.                                                                                [04:18:32] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
