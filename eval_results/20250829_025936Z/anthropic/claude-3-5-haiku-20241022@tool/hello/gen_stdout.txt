I'll use the `save` tool to create the Python script.
@save(toolu_01SPrbxHkvTH5XCgGW1tP27F): {"path": "hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")"}

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I've created a simple Python script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!" when executed. The script is now saved in the current directory (/tmp/gptme-evals-nmqmwub2). 

Would you like me to run the script or do anything else with it?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
