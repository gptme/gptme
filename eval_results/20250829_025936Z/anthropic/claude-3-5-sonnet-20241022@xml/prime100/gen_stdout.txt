User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll help you write a script to find the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
1. We need a function to check if a number is prime
2. We need to count prime numbers until we reach the 100th one
3. We'll use a simple but efficient approach by checking divisibility up to sqrt(n)

Let's test the script to make sure it works correctly:

<tool-use>
<shell>python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-hszmw8tp/prime.py</shell>
</tool-use>
                                                                                
Preview
python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-hszmw8tp/prime.py                                      

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-hszmw8tp/prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script is working correctly. It found that 541 is the 100th prime number. 

To verify this result:
<tool-use>
<shell>python3 -c "print(len([x for x in range(2, 542) if all(x % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1))]))"</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                
Preview
python3 -c "print(len([x for x in range(2, 542) if all(x % i != 0 for i in range

100
System: 
Ran command: `python3 -c "print(len())"`

`100`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Perfect! The verification confirms that 541 is indeed the 100th prime number, as there are exactly 100 prime numbers from 2 up to 541. The script is working as intended.
