Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple string change.

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
