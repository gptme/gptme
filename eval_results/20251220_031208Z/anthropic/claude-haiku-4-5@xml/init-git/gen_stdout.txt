User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it

The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

Let me start by initializing git, then creating a simple main.py file, and finally committing it.

Good, git repository initialized. Now I need to create a main.py file.

Now I need to commit the file. First I should add it to git, then commit it. I'll need to configure git user email and name if not already set.

Perfect! The commit was successful. The git repository has been initialized, a main.py file has been created with a simple Python script, and it has been committed to git. The commit hash is f7ae7a4 and it's the root commit on the main branch.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've:
1. Initialized a git repository
2. Created a `main.py` file with a simple Hello World script
3. Committed it with the message "Add main.py"

The commit hash is `f7ae7a4`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
