The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the appropriate content.

I got a permission denied error. Let me try with a relative path instead, or I should check what the current working directory permissions are. Let me try with just "hello.py" as a relative path.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the content `print("Hello, world!")`. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:43:11] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
