<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and then print "Hello, <name>!". I can use the patch tool to make this change.

Looking at the current content:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Store the name in a variable
3. Print "Hello, <name>!" with the stored name

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.
