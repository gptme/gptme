The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. I have the current content of hello.py shown in the code block.

I should use the patch tool to modify the file to ask for the user's name and then print a personalized greeting.

Let me patch it:
- Replace the current print statement with code that asks for the user's name
- Then print the greeting with that name
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

The patch was successfully applied. The user's hello.py file has been modified to ask for the user's name and then print "Hello, <name>!". The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script now asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
