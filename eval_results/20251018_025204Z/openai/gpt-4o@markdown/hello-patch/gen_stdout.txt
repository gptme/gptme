Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Here's the patch to update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!":

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

It seems there was an issue with applying the patch because the file `hello.py` could not be found. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to ensure that `hello.py` exists. Then, we can apply the patch again. 

Let's start by listing the files in the current directory.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
