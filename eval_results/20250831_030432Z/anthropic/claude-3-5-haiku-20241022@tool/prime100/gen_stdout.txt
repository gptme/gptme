User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll use the following approach:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run
</thinking>           </thinking>

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let me explain the script:
- `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
- `find_nth_prime(n)` finds the nth prime number by iterating through numbers and counting primes
- `main()` specifically finds the 100th prime number and prints it
- The script uses `if __name__ == "__main__":` to ensure the main function runs when the script is directly executed

The 100th prime number is 541, which the script successfully computed and printed. You can run this script anytime to get the same result.

Would you like me to explain any part of the script in more detail?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
