Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", I'll create a patch for you.

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

It seems there was an issue with the patch tool. Let's try using the save tool to overwrite the file instead. I'll provide the updated content for `hello.py`.

```python
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
