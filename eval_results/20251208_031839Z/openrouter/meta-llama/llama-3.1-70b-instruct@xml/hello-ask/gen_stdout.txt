modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'

<thinking>Let's use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file. We'll replace the existing print statement with a new one that asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting.</thinking>

System: ❌ 
Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This might be due to the fact that the file contents have changed since we last checked. Let's try to get the current contents of the file and then apply the patch again.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<shell>
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-6dvcwy21/hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                print("Hello, human!")System:

<thinking>Now that we have the current contents of the file, we can apply the patch again. This time, we'll make sure to use the correct original chunk.</thinking>
