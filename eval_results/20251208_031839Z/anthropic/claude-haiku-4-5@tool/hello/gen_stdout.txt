The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I need to use the save tool to create a file called hello.py with the appropriate Python code.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the code to print "Hello, world!". You can run it with:
```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
