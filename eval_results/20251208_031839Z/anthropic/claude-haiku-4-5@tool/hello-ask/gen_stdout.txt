<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of just printing "Hello, world!".

I need to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print a greeting with their name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
