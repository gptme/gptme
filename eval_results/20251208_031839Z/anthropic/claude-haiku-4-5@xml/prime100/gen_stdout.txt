User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll create a simple prime number generator. The most straightforward approach is to check each number for primality until we find 100 primes.

Let me write a script that:
- Has a function to check if a number is prime
- Iterates through numbers, counting primes until we reach 100
- Prints the 100th prime

Then I'll execute it.
