User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I need to use the save tool to create a hello.py file with a print statement.
</think>        </think>

<function_calls>
<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

Great! The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The task is complete. I could offer to run it to verify it works, but since the user hasn't asked for that, I'll just confirm what was done.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` which prints "Hello, world!". You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like to test it.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
