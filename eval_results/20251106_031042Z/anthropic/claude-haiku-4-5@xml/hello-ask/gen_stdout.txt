The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!'.

Looking at the current code:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' with the provided name

I can use the patch tool to make this modification.

name = input("What is your name? ")

Great! The patch was successfully applied. The file has been modified to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've updated `hello.py` to prompt the user for their name and display a personalized greeting. The script now uses `input()` to ask for the name and formats the output with an f-string.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
