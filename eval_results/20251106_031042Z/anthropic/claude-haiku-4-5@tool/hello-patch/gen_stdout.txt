Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I need to use the patch tool to modify the file. The current content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And it should be changed to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

Let me apply this patch using the conflict marker format.
