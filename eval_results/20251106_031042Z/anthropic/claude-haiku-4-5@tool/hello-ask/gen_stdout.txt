<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!'

I can see the current content is just `print("Hello, world!")`. I need to change it to use `input()` to ask for the name and then print a greeting with that name.

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
