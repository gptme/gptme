````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Here's the patch to update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!":

```patch /app/hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

It seems that the file `hello.py` is not located in the `/app` directory. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to locate `hello.py`. Could you please run the following commands?

```bash
pwd
ls -la
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
