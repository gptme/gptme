I'll use the `save` tool to create the hello.py script.
@save(toolu_0113s5bDHzosnZfZRL6v9LGu): {"path": "hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")"}

I've created a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. The script is saved in the current directory as `hello.py`. You can now run this script using Python.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
