User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let's write a script `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number when called.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Print the 100th prime number
print(nth_prime(100))
```

Now, let's save this script to a file named `prime.py` and then call it.

```shell
python prime.py
```

Please execute the above command to see the output.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
