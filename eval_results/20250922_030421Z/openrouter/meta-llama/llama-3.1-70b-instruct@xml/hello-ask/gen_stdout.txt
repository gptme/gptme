<thinking> To modify the hello.py file, we can use the patch tool to update the print statement to ask for the user's name and then print out a greeting with their name. </thinking>

System: ❌ 
Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking> The patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This is likely because the file contents have changed since the patch was created. To resolve this, we can try to patch the file again with the correct original chunk. </thinking>

First, let's check the current contents of the hello.py file:

<tool-use>
<shell>
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-y46ba1n0/hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>
                                                                                print("Hello, human!")System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat /tmp/gptme-evals-y46ba1n0/hello.py`

`print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking> Now that we have the current contents of the file, we can create a new patch with the correct original chunk. </thinking>

<tool-use>
<patch args='/tmp/gptme-evals-y46ba1n0/hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, human!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")

+name = input("What is your name? ")
