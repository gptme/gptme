User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple script called hello.py that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create this file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:
<think>       <think>
The user has confirmed that the file was saved successfully. The task is complete. I should acknowledge this briefly and offer to help with anything else if needed.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a simple print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like to test it.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
