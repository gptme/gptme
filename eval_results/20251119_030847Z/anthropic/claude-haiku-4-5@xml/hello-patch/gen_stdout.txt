Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to patch the code in hello.py to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I need to use the patch tool to modify the file. The user has shown me the content of hello.py directly, so I can apply the patch.

Let me create a patch that changes:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```
to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

Preview
-print("Hello, world!")
+print("Hello, human!")
