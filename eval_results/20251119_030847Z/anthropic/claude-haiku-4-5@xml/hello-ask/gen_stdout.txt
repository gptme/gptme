The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting. I should use the patch tool to make this change.

The current content is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to ask for the user's name and then print a greeting with that name.

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

Great! The patch was successfully applied. The user's hello.py file has been modified to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. The modification is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've modified `hello.py` to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. The script will now:
1. Prompt the user with "What is your name? "
2. Read their input
3. Print "Hello, {name}!"                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
