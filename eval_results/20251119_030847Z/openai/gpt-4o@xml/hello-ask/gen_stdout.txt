To modify `hello.py` to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, we can update the script as follows:

1. Use the `input()` function to prompt the user for their name.
2. Print the greeting using the provided name.

Let's apply this change to `hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
