User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: âœ… Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
Good, the file has been saved successfully. The user has confirmed that hello.py was created. I should let them know it's ready, and they can run it if they want to verify it works.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script has been created at `hello.py`. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
