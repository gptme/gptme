<think>       <think>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. 

I have the current content of hello.py:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' with the name they provided

I can use the patch tool to make this change.

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED

Done! The file now asks for the user's name and greets them with it.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
