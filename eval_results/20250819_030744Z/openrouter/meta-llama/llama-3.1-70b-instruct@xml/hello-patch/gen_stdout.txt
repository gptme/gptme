Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

<tool-use>
<patch args='/tmp/gptme-evals-l09ul4gj/hello.py'>

<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the fact that the file contents were not exactly as expected. Let me try again with a more flexible patch.</thinking>

<thinking>It seems that the patch still failed. I need to make sure that the original chunk is correct. Let me check the file contents again.</thinking>
