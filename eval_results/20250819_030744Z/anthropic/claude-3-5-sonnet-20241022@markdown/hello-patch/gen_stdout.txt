Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The change is simple and straightforward.

```patch /tmp/gptme-evals-zsplt1d8/hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The patch failed because I need to verify the exact content of the file first. Let me check the file content.
</thinking>           </thinking>

```bash
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-zsplt1d8/hello.py
```

<thinking>          <thinking>
Now that I can see the exact content, I'll create a precise patch. Sometimes line endings or invisible characters can cause patch failures, so it's important to verify the exact content first.

<thinking>          <thinking>
The patch is still failing. Let me check the file content more carefully, including any hidden characters or line endings.
