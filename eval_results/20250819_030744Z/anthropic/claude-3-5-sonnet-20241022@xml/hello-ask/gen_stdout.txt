I'll modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.

Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file

I apologize for the error. Let me check the actual content of the file first.

<tool-use>
<shell>
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-0i6u4d1v/hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>
                                                                                name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat /tmp/gptme-evals-0i6u4d1v/hello.py`

```stdout
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I see that the file has already been modified to what we wanted to achieve. It already:
1. Asks for the user's name using input()
2. Prints "Hello, {name}!" with the provided name

The file is already in the desired state, so no further modifications are needed.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
