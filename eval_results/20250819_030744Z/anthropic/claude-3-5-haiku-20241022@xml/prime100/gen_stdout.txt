User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
To solve this, I'll:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run

Let's verify the script works correctly by running it:

<tool-use>
<shell>python /tmp/gptme-evals-w3a4w8m1/prime.py</shell>
</tool-use>

python /tmp/gptme-evals-w3a4w8m1/prime.py                                       

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python /tmp/gptme-evals-w3a4w8m1/prime.py`

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Great! Let me break down what the script does:

1. `is_prime(n)` checks if a given number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.
2. `find_nth_prime(n)` finds the nth prime number by incrementally checking numbers and counting primes.
3. `main()` specifically finds the 100th prime number and prints it.

The script correctly identified 541 as the 100th prime number. 

Would you like me to explain the algorithm in more detail or make any modifications to the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
