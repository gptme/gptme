User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll create a function that:
1. Checks if a number is prime
2. Finds the 100th prime number
3. Prints the result
</thinking>           </thinking>

@save: {
  "path": "prime.py",
  "content": """def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return num
        num += 1

def main():
    hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
"""
}

Now, I'll verify the script works by running it:
@shell(toolu_01TeVenzWfMEo4AdBSChgMPP): {"command": "python prime.py"}                                                                                
Preview
python prime.py                                                                 

System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I apologize for the error. Let me first check the current working directory and then run the script:
@shell(toolu_01Wmd6PXagR4n9s9WiGuPNxd): {"command": "pwd && python /tmp/gptme-evals-6zh_5pls/prime.py"}                                                                                
Preview
pwd && python /tmp/gptme-evals-6zh_5pls/prime.py

```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Great! Let me explain the script:
- `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
- `find_nth_prime(n)` finds the nth prime number by counting primes
- `main()` finds and prints the 100th prime number
- The script prints 541, which is indeed the 100th prime number

The script successfully computes and prints the 100th prime number when called. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
