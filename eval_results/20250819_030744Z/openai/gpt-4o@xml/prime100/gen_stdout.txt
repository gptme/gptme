User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To compute the 100th prime number, we can use a simple algorithm that checks each number for primality until we find the 100th prime. I'll write a script `prime.py` to accomplish this. Let's start by creating the script.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
