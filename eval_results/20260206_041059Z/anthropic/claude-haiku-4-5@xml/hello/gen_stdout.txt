The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I just need to use the save tool to create hello.py with a print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked for a simple script to be created, and I've done that. The task is complete. I could offer to run it or ask if they want anything else, but let me keep it brief and professional.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created. You can run it with:
```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [04:10:36] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
