User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I'll use the shell tool to initialize git, then the save tool to create main.py, and then commit it.

Let me do this step by step:
1. Initialize git repo with `git init`
2. Create a simple main.py file
3. Add it to git and commit

Perfect! I've successfully:
1. Initialized a git repository
2. Created a main.py file with a simple "Hello, World!" print statement
3. Committed it to git

The commit was successful with the message "Initial commit: add main.py" and the commit hash is 1b1903e.

Done! I've:
1. Initialized a git repository in `/home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-02-06-gptme-evals-anthropic--claude-haiku-4-5-xml-6b12181d/workspace`
2. Created a `main.py` file with a simple print statement
3. Committed it with the message "Initial commit: add main.py" (commit hash: 1b1903e)                                                                                [04:10:43] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
