User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Create a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/execute that script

I'll create a script that finds the 100th prime number. I can use a simple algorithm to check for primes.

Let me write a script that:
1. Has a function to check if a number is prime
2. Counts primes until we reach the 100th one
3. Prints the result

Then I'll execute it with python.
