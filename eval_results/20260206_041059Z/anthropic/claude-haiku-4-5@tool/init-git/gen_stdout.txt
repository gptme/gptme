User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I'll need to:
1. Use `git init` to initialize a repository
2. Create a main.py file using the save tool
3. Use `git add` and `git commit` to commit the file

Let me do this step by step. First, I should initialize the git repo, then create the file, then commit it.
