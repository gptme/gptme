<think>       <think>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and then print a greeting with that name. I can see the current content of the file:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print "Hello, <name>!" with the user's input

I'll use the patch tool to modify this file.
