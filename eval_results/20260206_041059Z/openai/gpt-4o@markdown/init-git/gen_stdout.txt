User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let's start by initializing a git repository, creating a `main.py` file, and then committing it. I'll walk you through each step.

1. **Initialize a Git Repository**: We'll use `git init` to create a new git repository.
2. **Create `main.py`**: We'll write a simple Python script to `main.py`.
3. **Commit the File**: We'll add the file to the staging area and commit it.

Let's begin by initializing the git repository. 

```shell
git init
```                                                                                Initialized empty Git repository in /home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2026-02-06-gptme-evals-openai--gpt-4o-markdown-8c307a1f/workspace/.git/
System: 
Ran command: `git init`

The git repository has been initialized. Now, let's create the `main.py` file with a simple Python script.

```save main.py
print("Hello, World!")
```
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to main.py

The `main.py` file has been created. Next, let's add this file to the staging area and commit it to the repository.

```shell
git add main.py
git commit -m "Add main.py with a simple hello world script"
```                                                                                [main (root-commit) 9af6deb] Add main.py with a simple hello world script
