The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user's request has been completed. I should confirm this to the user.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the content `print("Hello, world!")`. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [03:29:21] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 957 context | 0% cached
