User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I should start by checking the current working directory, then initialize git, create a main.py file, and commit it.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<shell>
cd /app && pwd
</shell>
</tool-use>
                                                                                /app
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cd /app && pwd`

`/app`
System: <system_info>Working directory changed to: /app</system_info>

<think>       <think>
Good, I'm in /app. Now I'll:
1. Initialize git repository
2. Create a main.py file
3. Commit it
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<shell>
git init
</shell>
</tool-use>

System: 
Ran command: `git init`

It seems there's a permission issue with the /app directory. Let me check the current permissions and see what's happening.
