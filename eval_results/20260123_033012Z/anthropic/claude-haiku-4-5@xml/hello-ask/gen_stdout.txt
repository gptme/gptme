The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. I need to patch the file to:
1. Get the user's name using input()
2. Print the greeting with the name

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>

The patch was successfully applied. The user's hello.py file now:
1. Asks the user for their name using input()
2. Prints "Hello, <name>!" using an f-string

The task is complete. I should confirm this to the user.
</think>        </think>

Done! The file now asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting.                                                                                [03:29:25] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
