The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple patch task.

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

The patch was successfully applied. The user asked me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", and I did that. The system confirmed the patch was successfully applied.

I should acknowledge this success briefly.
</think>        </think>

Done! The code now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".                                                                                [03:29:23] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
