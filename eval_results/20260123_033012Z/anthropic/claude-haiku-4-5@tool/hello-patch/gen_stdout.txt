Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

I need to:
1. Use the patch tool
2. The path is "hello.py"
3. Change the print statement to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!"

I'll create a patch using git conflict markers.
