It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from saving the file in the `/app` directory. Let's try saving the script in a different directory where I have write access. Could you please let me know a suitable directory, or if you can adjust the permissions for the `/app` directory?                                                                                [04:29:35] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 802 context | 0% cached
