The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create hello.py with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a script that prints "Hello, world!". You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [04:29:44] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 962 context | 0% cached
