Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple modification.

I need to use the patch tool with:
- path: "hello.py"
- patch: the conflict markers showing the original and updated content

Let me create the patch:
```
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
</think>        </think>


@patch(toolu_011acQFzxn6PwukBvCCa9tSK): {"path": "hello.py", "patch": "<<<<<<< ORIGINAL\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n=======\nprint(\"Hello, human!\")\n>>>>>>> UPDATED"}                                                                                System: ✅ Patch successfully applied to
