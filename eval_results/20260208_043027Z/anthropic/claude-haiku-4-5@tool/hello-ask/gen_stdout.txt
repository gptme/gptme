<think>       <think>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. 

I have the current content:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' with the user's name

I should use the patch tool to modify this file.
