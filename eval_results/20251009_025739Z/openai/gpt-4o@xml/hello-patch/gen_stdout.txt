Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", I'll create a patch for you. 

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Let's apply the patch: 

<tool-use>
<patch args='/tmp/gptme-evals-wijeh7em/hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

+print("Hello, human!")

Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems there was an issue with applying the patch. Let's first check the contents of the `hello.py` file to ensure it matches what we expect. Then, I'll attempt to apply the patch again. 

Let's list the contents of the current directory to confirm the file's presence and then read the file.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
