Sure! I'll create a script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!". 

Let's save the script: 

<tool-use>
<save args='/tmp/gptme-evals-fr8vep47/hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: âœ… Saved to /tmp/gptme-evals-fr8vep47/hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script `hello.py` has been created and it prints "Hello, world!". You can run it using the following command:

```bash
python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-fr8vep47/hello.py
```

Let me know if you need any further assistance!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
