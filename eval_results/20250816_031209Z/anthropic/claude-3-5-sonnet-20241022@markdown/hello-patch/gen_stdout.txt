Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file, changing the message from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"
</thinking>           </thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

System: âœ… Patch successfully applied to `hello.py`

The patch has been applied successfully. The code in hello.py now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
