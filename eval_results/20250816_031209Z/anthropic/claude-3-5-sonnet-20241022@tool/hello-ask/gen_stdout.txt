I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.
The original code is a simple print statement, and we need to:
1. Add input() to get the user's name
2. Modify the print statement to use the name variable

I've modified the file to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. The program will now:
1. Prompt the user for their name
2. Store it in the `name` variable
3. Print "Hello, " followed by their name and an exclamation mark                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
