<thinking> It seems that the file hello.py is not located in the directory I was expecting. I need to find the correct path to the file. </thinking>

Let me try to find the correct path to the file hello.py. Can you please execute the following command to list the files in the current directory?

```bash
ls
```

This will help me determine the correct path to the file.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
