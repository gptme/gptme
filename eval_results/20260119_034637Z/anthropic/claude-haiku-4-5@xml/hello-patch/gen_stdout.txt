Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple string replacement.

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. I'll replace the "Hello, world!" string with "Hello, human!".

<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")

print("Hello, human!")
