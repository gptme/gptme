User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a file called hello.py with the appropriate content.

I got a permission denied error when trying to write to /app/hello.py. Let me try using a relative path instead. Since the current working directory is /app, I should be able to use just "hello.py" as a relative path.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the content `print("Hello, world!")`. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:45:56] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
