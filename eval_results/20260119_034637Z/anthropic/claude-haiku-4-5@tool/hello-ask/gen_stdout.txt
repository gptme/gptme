The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print "Hello, <name>!". 

I have the current content of hello.py:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I can use the patch tool to make this modification. The patch should:
- Replace the single print statement with code that asks for a name and prints a personalized greeting.

Let me create the patch:

Done! I've modified hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. The script now:
1. Asks "What is your name? "
2. Prints "Hello, {name}!"                                                                                [03:45:53] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 3k context | 0% cached
