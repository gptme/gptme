The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. 

I should use the patch tool to modify the file. The current content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' with the provided name

Let me create a patch for this.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Patch successfully applied to

The patch was successfully applied. The user's hello.py file has been modified to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print a greeting with the user's name using an f-string

The task is complete. I should confirm this to the user.
</think>        </think>

Done! The file has been updated to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.                                                                                [04:18:00] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
