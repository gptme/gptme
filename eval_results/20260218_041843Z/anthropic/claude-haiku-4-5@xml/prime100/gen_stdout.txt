User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll write a script that finds the 100th prime number. A simple approach is to check each number for primality until we've found 100 primes.

Let me create the script and then run it.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="prime.py">
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
num = 2
while count < 100:
    if is_prime(num):
        count += 1
        if count == 100:
            print(f"The 100th prime number is: {num}")
            break
    num += 1
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
Now I need to run the script to show the output. I'll use the shell tool to execute python prime.py
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<shell>
python prime.py
</shell>
</tool-use>
                                                                                The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
Great! The script ran successfully and found that the 100th prime number is 541. The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! The 100th prime number is **541**.                                                                                [04:18:04] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
