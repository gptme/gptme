The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple string replacement.

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

Great! The patch was successfully applied. The file hello.py now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". 

The user can now see that the change has been made. I don't need to do anything else - the task is complete.
