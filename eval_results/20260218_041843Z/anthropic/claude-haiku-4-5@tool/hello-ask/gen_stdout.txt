The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print a greeting with that name. I should use the patch tool to modify the file.

Currently the file contains:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print a greeting with that name

Let me use the patch tool to make this change.
