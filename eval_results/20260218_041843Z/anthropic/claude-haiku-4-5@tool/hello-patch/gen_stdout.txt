The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. The patch should replace the original line with the updated one.

The original content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

The updated content should be:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

I'll create a patch using the conflict markers format.
