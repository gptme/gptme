Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems like the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the fact that the file contents were not exactly as I expected them to be. Let me try to get the current contents of the file and then apply the patch again.</thinking>
