User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with a print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed it was saved to hello.py. I should acknowledge this is complete, and optionally offer to run it if they want to verify it works.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py` if you want to verify it works.                                                                                [04:28:20] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 963 context | 0% cached
