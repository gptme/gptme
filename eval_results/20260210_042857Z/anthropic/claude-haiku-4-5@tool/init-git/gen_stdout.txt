The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I should do this step by step:
1. First initialize git with `git init`
2. Create a main.py file with some basic content
3. Add and commit the file

Let me start with initializing git and creating the main.py file, then commit it.
