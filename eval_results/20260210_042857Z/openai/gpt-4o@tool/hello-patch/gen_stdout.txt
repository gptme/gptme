It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the `/app` directory. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to locate `hello.py`.

It seems there is a persistent issue with locating the file `hello.py`. Let's try a different approach by checking the directory structure to find the correct location of the file. Could you please provide the correct path or confirm if the file exists in the `/app` directory?                                                                                [04:28:09] Session: $0.02 | 4 turns | 1k context | 69% cached
