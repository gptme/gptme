Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll create a patch for you.

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

It seems there was an issue with applying the patch because the file `hello.py` does not exist in the current directory. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to ensure the file is present. Could you please execute the following commands?

```bash
pwd
ls -l
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
