Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the fact that the file contents were not exactly as I expected.

Let me try again, but this time I will make sure to get the exact file contents before applying the patch.

First, I will use the `cat` command to print the contents of the file.
