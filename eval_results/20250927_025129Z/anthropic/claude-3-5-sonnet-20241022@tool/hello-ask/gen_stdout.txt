<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.
The original content is a simple print statement, and we'll replace it with input for the name and an f-string.

I've modified the file to:
1. Ask for the user's name using `input()`
2. Store it in a variable called `name`
3. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string with the format you specified

The program will now ask for input and respond with "Hello, <name>!" where <name> is whatever the user enters.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
