User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
1. I'll write a Python script that:
   - Implements a function to check if a number is prime
   - Iterates until we find the 100th prime
   - Prints the result
2. I'll use an efficient approach checking divisibility up to square root
3. After saving, I'll run it to verify

Let's run the script to get the 100th prime number:

python3 prime.py                                                                

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script successfully ran and found that 541 is the 100th prime number. 

Would you like me to verify this result or make any modifications to the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
