The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")

<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user now has a hello.py script that prints "Hello, world!" when executed. I should confirm this is done and offer to help them run it if needed.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script has been saved to `hello.py`. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [03:46:50] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
