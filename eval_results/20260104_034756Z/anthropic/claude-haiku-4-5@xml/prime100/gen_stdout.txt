User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run that script

I'll create a script that finds the 100th prime number. I can use a simple primality test approach.

Let me write a script that:
1. Has a function to check if a number is prime
2. Counts prime numbers until we reach 100
3. Prints the 100th prime

Then I'll execute it.
