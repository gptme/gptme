Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

The user wants me to patch the code in hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. The patch should:
- Find the line with `print("Hello, world!")`
- Replace it with `print("Hello, human!")`

Let me create the patch with the correct conflict markers.

The file doesn't exist at /app/hello.py. Let me first check what the current working directory is and see if the file exists elsewhere. The user mentioned the file is "hello.py" but didn't specify a full path. Let me check the current directory first.

I need to create the file first. Let me check the current working directory and create hello.py:
