The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. I have the current content of hello.py shown, and I can use the patch tool to make this modification.

The current code is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

Done! The file now asks for the user's name and greets them with a personalized message. You can test it by running:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [03:46:51] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 3k context | 0% cached
