Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Here's the patch to update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!":

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

It seems there was an issue with applying the patch because the file `hello.py` does not exist in the current directory. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to ensure the file is present. 

I'll run the necessary commands to verify the file's existence.                                                                                [03:46:37] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 998 context | 0% cached
