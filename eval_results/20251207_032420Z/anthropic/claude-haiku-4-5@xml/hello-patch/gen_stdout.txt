Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple string replacement.

I should use the patch tool to make this change. The user has provided the current content of the file, so I can see what needs to be changed.
