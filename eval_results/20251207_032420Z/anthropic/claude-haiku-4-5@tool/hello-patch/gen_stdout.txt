Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. The change is simple - I just need to replace "Hello, world!" with "Hello, human!".
