<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. I have the current content of the file shown in the message.

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file to:
1. Ask for the user's input
2. Print a personalized greeting with their name

Let me create a patch that changes the print statement to ask for input and then print the greeting.
