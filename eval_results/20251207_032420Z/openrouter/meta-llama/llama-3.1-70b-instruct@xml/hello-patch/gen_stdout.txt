Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>Let's use the patch tool to modify the code in hello.py. We need to specify the file path and the changes to be made.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<patch args='/tmp/gptme-evals-brlejd1c/hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

+print("Hello, human!")

Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the file not existing or the original code not matching the expected code. Let's try to get the current contents of the file to see what's going on.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<exec args='cat /tmp/gptme-evals-brlejd1c/hello.py'>
</exec>
