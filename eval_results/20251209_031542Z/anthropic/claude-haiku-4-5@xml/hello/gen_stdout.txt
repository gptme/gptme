User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user asked me to write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!" and I've successfully done that. The system confirmed the file was saved. There's nothing more I need to do unless the user asks me to run it or make changes to it.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created and will print "Hello, world!" when executed.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
