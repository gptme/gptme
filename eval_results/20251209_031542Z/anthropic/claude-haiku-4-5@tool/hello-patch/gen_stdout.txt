Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I'll use the patch tool to make this change. I need to:
1. Find the line `print("Hello, world!")`
2. Replace it with `print("Hello, human!")`

This is a simple one-line change.

The file doesn't exist at the path I used. The working directory is actually `/home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2025-12-09-gptme-evals-anthropic--claude-haiku-4-5-tool-45025/workspace`. I need to create the file there first or patch it at the correct location.

Let me use the absolute path to the current working directory. The file should be in the workspace directory.
