User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll use the `save` tool to create the `hello.py` script:
@save(toolu_01TK719xU77pUVJHa43iJKY6): {"path": "hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")"}

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: âœ… Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I've created a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. The script is saved in the current directory as `hello.py`. You can now run this script using Python.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
