User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number:

<thinking>          <thinking>
To solve this, I'll:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run

System: 
Ran command: `python /tmp/gptme-evals-cbx876ip/prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The script successfully found the 100th prime number, which is 541. 
Let me break down how the script works:
- `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
- `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
- `main()` calls `find_nth_prime(100)` to get the 100th prime number
</thinking>           </thinking>

The script is working as expected. Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation or do you have any further requirements?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
