User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

Let's write a script to find the 100th prime number. We'll need:
1. A function to check if a number is prime
2. A way to count prime numbers until we reach the 100th one
3. Print the result
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(find_nth_prime(100))
```

    if n < 2:

    print(find_nth_prime(100))                                                  

System: âœ… Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let's test the script to make sure it works:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```
                                                                                
Preview
python3 prime.py                                                                

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script is working correctly. It found that 541 is the 100th prime number. 

We can verify this is correct by checking against known prime number lists - 541 is indeed the 100th prime number.

The script:
1. Uses trial division up to the square root to check for primality
2. Counts prime numbers until it reaches the 100th one
3. Returns and prints the result (541)

Would you like to make any modifications to the script or would you like to test it with a different n-th prime?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
