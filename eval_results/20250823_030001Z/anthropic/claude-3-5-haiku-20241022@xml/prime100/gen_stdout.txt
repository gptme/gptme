User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll break this down into steps:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Create a function to find the nth prime number
3. Print the 100th prime number when the script is run

541
System: 
Ran command: `python /tmp/gptme-evals-8zu_k51v/prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The script successfully printed 541, which is indeed the 100th prime number. Let me break down how the script works:

1. `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime(n)` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it finds the nth prime
3. `main()` calls `find_nth_prime(100)` to get the 100th prime number
4. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensures the script can be imported without automatically running

The implementation is efficient for small n, though it would become slow for very large prime indices.

Would you like me to explain the algorithm in more detail or modify the script in any way?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
