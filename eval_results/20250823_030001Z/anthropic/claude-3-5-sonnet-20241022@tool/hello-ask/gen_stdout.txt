<thinking>          <thinking>
1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file
2. I can use the patch tool to make this change
3. The change involves:
   - Adding an input() statement to get the user's name
   - Modifying the print statement to use the name variable
4. The file content is simple, so a small patch will work well

I've modified hello.py to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string
3. Used single quotes for 'Hello' as specified in your request

The program will now ask for a name and print a personalized greeting when run.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
