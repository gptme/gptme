To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, I'll update the script accordingly. Here's the patch:

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Invalid patch: invalid patch, no `<<<<<<<

It seems there was an issue with the patch format. Let me correct that and apply the patch again.

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Invalid patch: invalid patch, no `<<<<<<<

It seems there is a persistent issue with the patch format. Let me try a different approach by rewriting the entire file.

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
</save>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py (overwritten)
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The `hello.py` script has been updated to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. The script now looks like this:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

You can run the script to see the changes in action.                                                                                [04:20:41] Session: $0.04 | 4 turns | 2k context | 24% cached
