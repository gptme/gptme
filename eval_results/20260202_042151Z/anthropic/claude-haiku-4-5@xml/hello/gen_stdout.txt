User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been successfully saved. The user asked me to write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!" and I've completed that task. The system confirmed it was saved to hello.py. I should let the user know it's ready to run if they want to verify it.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like to verify it works.                                                                                [04:20:49] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
