Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

The original line is:
    print("Hello, world!")

And it should be changed to:
    print("Hello, human!")

I'll use the patch tool with the appropriate conflict markers.
