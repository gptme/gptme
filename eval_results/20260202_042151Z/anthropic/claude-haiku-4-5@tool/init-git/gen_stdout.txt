User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

Let me break this down:
1. First, I'll initialize a git repo using `git init`
2. Then create a main.py file
3. Add it to git with `git add`
4. Commit it with `git commit`

I should check the current working directory first to make sure I'm in the right place. The system info says I'm in `/app`, so I should be good there.

Let me start by initializing the repo, creating the file, and committing. I can do the init and create the file in parallel, but the commit needs to happen after both.
