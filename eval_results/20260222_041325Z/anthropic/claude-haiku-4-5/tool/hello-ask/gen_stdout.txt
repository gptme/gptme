The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print "Hello, <name>!". 

Currently the file contains:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.
