The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I need to use the save tool to create a file called hello.py with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>


@save(toolu_0126NED4rtjLwGtKT8mfd7hW): {"path": "hello.py", "content": "print(\"Hello, world!\")\n"}                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
