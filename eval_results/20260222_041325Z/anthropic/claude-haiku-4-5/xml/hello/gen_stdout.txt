User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the appropriate Python code.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. I should let the user know it's done. I could also offer to run it if they'd like, but I'll keep it brief since they didn't ask for that.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with:

```
python hello.py
```                                                                                [04:12:46] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 965 context | 0% cached
