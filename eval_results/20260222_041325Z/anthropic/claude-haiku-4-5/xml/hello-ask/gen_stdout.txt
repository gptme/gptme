The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. I should use the patch tool to make this change.

The current file contains:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print a greeting with that name

Let me apply a patch to make this change.

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Patch successfully applied to

The patch has been successfully applied. The user's hello.py file has been modified to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with it. The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! Your `hello.py` now asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```                                                                                [04:12:48] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
