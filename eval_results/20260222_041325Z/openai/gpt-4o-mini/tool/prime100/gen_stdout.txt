It seems that I don't have permission to create or modify files in the `/app` directory. Let's check the permissions of the current directory to understand the issue better. I'll run a command to list the permissions.

The `/app` directory has restricted permissions, which is why I can't create or modify files there. 

To proceed, I can either:
1. Attempt to create the script in a different directory where I have write permissions.
2. Provide you with the code, and you can create the file manually.

Which option would you prefer?                                                                                [04:12:42] Session: $0.00 | 4 turns | 2k context | 50% cached
