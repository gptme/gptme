User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

Let me write a simple prime number script. I'll need an algorithm to find prime numbers. A simple approach would be to check each number for primality and count until we reach the 100th prime.

Here's the approach:
- Create a function to check if a number is prime
- Loop through numbers, counting primes until we reach the 100th one
- Print the result

Let me write this script and then run it.
