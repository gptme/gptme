Sure! I'll create a script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!". 

Let's write the script: 

<tool-use>
<save args='/tmp/gptme-evals-3rcvwjxt/hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

The script `hello.py` has been created. It will print "Hello, world!" when executed. Would you like to run it now?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
