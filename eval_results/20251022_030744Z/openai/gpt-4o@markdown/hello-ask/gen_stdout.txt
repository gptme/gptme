To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, we can update the script as follows:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

The `hello.py` script has been updated to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. If you run the script, it will now prompt for the user's name and greet them accordingly.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
