The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". I should use the save tool to create the file hello.py with the appropriate Python code.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. I should confirm that the task is complete and offer to help with anything else.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created and will print "Hello, world!" when executed.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
