Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a simple string replacement.

I need to use the patch tool to modify the file. I'll use the adapted git conflict markers format to change the print statement.
