<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print it in the format 'Hello, <name>!'.

Currently it says:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print "Hello, <name>!" with the name they provided

I can use the patch tool to make this change.
