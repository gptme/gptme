I'll modify the hello.py file to ask for the user's name using the patch tool:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

The file has been updated successfully. Now when you run hello.py, it will:
1. Ask for your name using input()
2. Print a personalized greeting with the name you entered

Would you like me to show you how to run it or make any other modifications?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
