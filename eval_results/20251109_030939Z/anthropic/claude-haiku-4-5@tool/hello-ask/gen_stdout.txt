<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. 

Currently it has:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print "Hello, <name>!" with the name they provided

I'll use the patch tool to modify this file.
