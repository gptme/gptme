User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward. I'll use the save tool to create the file hello.py with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been successfully saved. The user asked me to write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!", and I've done that. The system confirmed the file was saved. I should let the user know it's done and potentially offer to run it or do anything else they'd like.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the script that prints "Hello, world!". Would you like me to run it to verify it works?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
