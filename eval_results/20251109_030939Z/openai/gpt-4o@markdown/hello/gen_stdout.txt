Here's a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!":

```save /app/hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ❌ Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'

It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from writing to the `/app` directory. You might need to adjust the permissions or choose a different directory where I can save the file. Could you let me know how you'd like to proceed?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
