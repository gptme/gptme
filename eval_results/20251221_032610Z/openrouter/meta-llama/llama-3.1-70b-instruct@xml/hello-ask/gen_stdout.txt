<thinking>Let's use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file. We'll add a line to ask for the user's name and then print out a greeting with their name.</thinking>

System: ❌ 
Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems like the patch failed because the original chunk wasn't found in the file. This might be because the file contents have changed since we last checked. Let's take another look at the file and try again.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<shell>
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-nzxyk0cg/hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                print("Hello, human!")System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat /tmp/gptme-evals-nzxyk0cg/hello.py`

<thinking>Now that we have the current contents of the file, we can try to patch it again. This time, we'll make sure to patch the correct original chunk.</thinking>
