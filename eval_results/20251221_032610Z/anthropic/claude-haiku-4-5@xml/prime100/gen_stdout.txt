User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll create a script that finds the 100th prime number and prints it.

Let me think about the implementation:
- I need a function to check if a number is prime
- Then iterate through numbers, counting primes until I reach the 100th one
- Print the result

I'll use a simple primality test - checking if a number is divisible by any number up to its square root.
