The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

I need to use the patch tool to change the output string.

The patch was successfully applied. The user asked me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", and the system confirmed the patch was applied successfully.

I should acknowledge this completion. Since the user's response preference is to not explain basic concepts, I'll keep this brief.

Done! The file has been patched to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
