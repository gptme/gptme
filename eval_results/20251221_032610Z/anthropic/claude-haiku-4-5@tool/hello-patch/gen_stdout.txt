Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a straightforward patch task.

I need to use the patch tool to change the string from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".
