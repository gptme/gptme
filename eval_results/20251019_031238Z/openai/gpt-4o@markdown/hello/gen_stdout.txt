Here's a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!":

```save /app/hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ‚ùå Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from writing to the `/app` directory. You can try running the command with elevated permissions or change the directory permissions. Alternatively, you can specify a different directory where you have write access. Let me know how you would like to proceed!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
