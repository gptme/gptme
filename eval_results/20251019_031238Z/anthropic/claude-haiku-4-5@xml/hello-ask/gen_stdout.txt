The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. I should use the patch tool to make this modification while preserving the file structure.

The current file just prints "Hello, world!". I need to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print a personalized greeting

Let me apply a patch to this file.

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

Great! The patch was successfully applied. The user's file has been modified to ask for their name and print a personalized greeting. The modification is complete and the user can now run the script to test it.
</think>        </think>

Done! The file now prompts the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting. You can test it:

```
python hello.py
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
