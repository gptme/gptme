User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: âœ… Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been successfully saved. I should let the user know it's done and offer to run it if they'd like.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
