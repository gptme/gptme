User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call the script to run it

I'll write a simple prime number finder that finds the 100th prime number. Let me create the script and then run it.

I'll use a simple approach:
- A function to check if a number is prime
- A loop to find the first 100 primes
- Print the 100th one
