User: 
Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". 

I need to use the patch tool with:
- path: hello.py
- patch: A git conflict marker format showing the original and updated code

The change is simple - just replacing the string in the print statement.
