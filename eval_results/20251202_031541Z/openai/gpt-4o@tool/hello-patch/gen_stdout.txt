It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the `/app` directory. Let's first check the current directory structure to locate the file.

It seems there is an issue with locating the file `hello.py`. Let's list the files in the current directory to find the correct path. Could you please execute the following command to list the files?

```bash
ls -R /app
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
