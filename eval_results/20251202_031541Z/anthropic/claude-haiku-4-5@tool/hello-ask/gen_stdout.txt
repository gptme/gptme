<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. 

The current file contains:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to modify it to:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!'

I can use the patch tool to modify this file. Let me create a patch that replaces the current print statement with code that asks for the user's name and prints a greeting.
