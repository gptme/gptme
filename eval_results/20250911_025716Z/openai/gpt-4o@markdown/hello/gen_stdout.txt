It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from writing to the `/app` directory. You might need to adjust the permissions or choose a different directory where I can save the file. Alternatively, you can create the file manually with the following content:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
