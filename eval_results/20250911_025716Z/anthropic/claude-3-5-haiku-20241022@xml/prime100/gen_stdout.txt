User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll help you write a Python script to find the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll break this down into steps:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Create a function to find the 100th prime number
3. Write the script to print the result when called

System: 
Ran command: `python /tmp/gptme-evals-_2keelfx/prime.py`

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Great! Let me break down what the script does:

1. `is_prime(n)` checks if a given number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.
2. `find_nth_prime(n)` finds the nth prime number by incrementally checking numbers and counting primes.
3. `main()` specifically finds the 100th prime number and prints it.

The result shows that the 100th prime number is 541. 

Would you like me to explain the algorithm in more detail or modify the script in any way?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
