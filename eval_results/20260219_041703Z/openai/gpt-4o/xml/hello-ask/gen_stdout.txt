To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, we can update the script as follows:

1. Use the `input()` function to prompt the user for their name.
2. Use an f-string to format the greeting message with the user's name.

Let's apply this change to the `hello.py` file.                                                                                [04:16:04] Session: $0.01 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
