To modify `hello.py` to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, we can update the script as follows:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                System: ✅ Patch successfully applied to

The `hello.py` script has been updated to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. If you run the script, it will prompt you for your name and then greet you with "Hello, \<name\>!".                                                                                [04:16:00] Session: $0.02 | 2 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
