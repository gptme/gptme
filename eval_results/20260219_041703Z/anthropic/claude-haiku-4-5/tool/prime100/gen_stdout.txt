User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll need to:
1. Create a prime.py file with code to find the 100th prime number
2. Execute the script using the shell

Let me write a simple prime-finding script that will find the 100th prime number.
