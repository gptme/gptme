User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it

The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I'll need to:
1. Use `git init` to initialize the repository
2. Use `save` to create a main.py file with some basic content
3. Use `git add main.py` to stage the file
4. Use `git config` to set user.email and user.name (required for commits)
5. Use `git commit` to commit the file

Let me do these steps. I should first check the current directory.
