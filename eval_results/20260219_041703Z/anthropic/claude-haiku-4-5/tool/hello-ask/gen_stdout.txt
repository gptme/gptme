The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print "Hello, <name>!" instead of just "Hello, world!".

I can use the patch tool to make this modification. I need to:
1. Replace the print statement with input() to ask for the name
2. Then print the greeting with the name

Let me create a patch that does this.
