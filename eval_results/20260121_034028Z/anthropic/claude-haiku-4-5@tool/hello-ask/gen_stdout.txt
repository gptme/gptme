<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print it in a greeting. I need to use the patch tool to modify the file.

The current content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
