User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I should do this step by step using the shell tool and the save tool.

Let me:
1. Initialize git repo with `git init`
2. Create a main.py file with some simple content
3. Add and commit the file

Great, git repo is initialized. Now I'll create a main.py file and then commit it.
</think>        </think>

print("Hello world")

Now I need to add and commit the file. I'll use git add and git commit.

git add main.py && git commit -m "Initial commit"

Perfect! All three tasks have been completed successfully:
1. Git repository initialized
2. main.py file created with a simple print statement
3. File committed with message "Initial commit"

The user asked me to do these three things and they're all done. I should confirm this briefly.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've:
1. Initialized a git repository
2. Created a `main.py` file with a simple hello world script
3. Committed it with the message "Initial commit"                                                                                [03:39:54] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
