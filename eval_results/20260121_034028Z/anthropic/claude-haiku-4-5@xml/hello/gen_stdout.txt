User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"

The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward. I'll use the save tool to write the file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed it was saved to hello.py. 

I could offer to run it to show that it works, but the user didn't ask for that. I'll keep it brief and professional.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` is ready. You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [03:39:46] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 957 context | 0% cached
