It seems there was an issue with locating the file `hello.py`. Let's list the files in the current directory to verify its existence or determine if it needs to be created. Could you please provide the list of files in the current directory?                                                                                [03:39:34] Session: $0.02 | 3 turns | 1k context | 33% cached
