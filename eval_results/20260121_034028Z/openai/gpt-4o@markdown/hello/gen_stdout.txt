System: ❌ Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from writing to the `/app` directory. You can try running the command with elevated permissions or change the directory permissions. Alternatively, I can provide you with the code, and you can create the file manually. Here is the content for `hello.py`:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Let me know how you would like to proceed!                                                                                [03:39:33] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 790 context | 0% cached
