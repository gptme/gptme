Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Here's the patch to update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

```patch /app/hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

It seems that the file `hello.py` is not located in the `/app` directory. Let's first check the current working directory and list the files to locate `hello.py`. Then, I can apply the patch correctly. 

Please execute the following commands to help me locate the file:

```bash
pwd
ls -la
```                                                                                [03:39:33] Session: $0.01 | 2 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
