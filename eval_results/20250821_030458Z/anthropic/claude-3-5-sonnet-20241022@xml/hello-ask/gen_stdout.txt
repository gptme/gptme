I apologize for the error. Let me verify the current content of the file first.

Ah, I see the issue. The file content is different from what I assumed. Let me patch it with the correct original content.

name = input("What is your name? ")

The file has been successfully modified. Now it will:
1. Ask for the user's name using `input()`
2. Print a personalized greeting using that name

You can run the script and it will prompt you for your name before displaying the greeting.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
