<thinking> To modify the hello.py file, we can use the patch tool. We need to replace the existing print statement with a new one that asks for the user's name and prints a greeting. </thinking>

System: âœ… Patch successfully applied to `/tmp/gptme-evals-gfy0oivx/hello.py`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The patch has been applied to the hello.py file. The file now contains the following code:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

You can run the script to test it.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
