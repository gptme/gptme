Let's start by initializing a git repository, creating a `main.py` file, and then committing it. I'll walk you through each step.

1. **Initialize a Git repository**:
   ```shell
   git init
   ```

2. **Create a `main.py` file**:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

3. **Add the file to the staging area**:
   ```shell
   git add main.py
   ```

4. **Commit the file**:
   ```shell
   git commit -m "Add main.py with a hello world script"
   ```

Let's execute these steps. I'll start by initializing the git repository.                                                                                [04:01:18] Session: $0.01 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
