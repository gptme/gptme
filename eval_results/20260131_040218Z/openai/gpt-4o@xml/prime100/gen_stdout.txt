User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To compute the 100th prime number, we can use a simple algorithm that checks each number for primality until we find the 100th prime. I'll write the script `prime.py` for you.                                                                                [04:01:15] Session: $0.01 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
