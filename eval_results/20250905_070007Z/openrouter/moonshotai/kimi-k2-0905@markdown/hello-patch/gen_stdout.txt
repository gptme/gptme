The user wants me to patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". I can see the current content of the file is just a simple print statement. I need to use the patch tool to modify this line.
</thinking>           </thinking>

I'll patch the hello.py file to change the greeting from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!":

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
