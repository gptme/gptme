The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. I need to:
1. Read the current hello.py file to see its content
2. Modify it to use input() to get the user's name
3. Print "Hello, <name>!" instead of "Hello, world!"

Let me first check the current content of hello.py.

I'll modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.

Perfect! I've modified hello.py to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Store the input in a variable called `name`
3. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

The file now contains:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
