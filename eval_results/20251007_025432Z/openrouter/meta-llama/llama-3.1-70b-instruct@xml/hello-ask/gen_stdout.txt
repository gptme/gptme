<thinking> It seems that the file hello.py does not exist in the current directory. I should have checked if the file exists before trying to patch it. Let me try again. </thinking>

First, I will check if the file exists in the current directory.

<tool-use>
<shell>
ls hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                hello.py
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `ls hello.py`

`hello.py`
