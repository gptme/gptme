Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

I'll help you patch the `hello.py` file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
@patch(toolu_01LGBrC1ebfv363myzWQguEU): {"path": "hello.py", "patch": "<<<<<<< ORIGINAL\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n=======\nprint(\"Hello, human!\")\n>>>>>>> UPDATED"}
