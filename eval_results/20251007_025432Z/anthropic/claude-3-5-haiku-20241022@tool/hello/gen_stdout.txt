I'll use the `save` tool to create the Python script.

I've created a simple Python script named `hello.py` that prints "Hello, world!" when executed. The script is now saved in the current directory (/tmp/gptme-evals-r6gzf63s). You can run it using Python to see the output.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
