User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll break this down into steps:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Create a function to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run

541
System: 
Ran command: `python /tmp/gptme-evals-817pbpnc/prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script successfully found the 100th prime number, which is 541. 

Let me break down how the script works:
- `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
- `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it finds the nth prime
- When run directly, the script prints the 100th prime number

Would you like me to explain the algorithm in more detail or modify the script in any way?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
