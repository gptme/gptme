Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". 

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. The patch should replace:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

with:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

Let me apply this patch.
