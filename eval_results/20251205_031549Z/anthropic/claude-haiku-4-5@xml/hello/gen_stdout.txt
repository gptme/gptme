User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I just need to create a file called hello.py with a print statement.

I'll use the save tool to create the file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user confirmed that the file was saved successfully. The task is complete. The hello.py script has been created with the print statement that outputs "Hello, world!". I should acknowledge this and let them know they can now run it.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
