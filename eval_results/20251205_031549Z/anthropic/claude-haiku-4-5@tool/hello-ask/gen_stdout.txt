The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting. I can use the patch tool to make this change.

I need to:
1. Change the print statement to ask for the user's name
2. Store the input
3. Print a greeting with the name

Let me apply a patch to modify the file.

Done! I've modified hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. Let me verify it works:

Perfect! The file has been updated. It now asks for the user's name using `input()` and prints a personalized greeting.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
