Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The change is simple and straightforward.
</thinking>           </thinking>

```patch /tmp/gptme-evals-anunsfxb/hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
The patch failed because I need to verify the exact content of the file first. Let me check the file content.
</thinking>           </thinking>

```bash
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-anunsfxb/hello.py
```

<thinking>          <thinking>
Now that I can see the exact content, I'll create a precise patch. Sometimes line endings or invisible characters can cause patch failures, so it's always good to verify the exact content first.
</thinking>           </thinking>

```patch /tmp/gptme-evals-anunsfxb/hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED

+print("Hello, human!")

<thinking>          <thinking>
The patch is still failing. Let me try to save the entire file content instead of using patch, since this is a very small file and we're replacing the entire content anyway.
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save /tmp/gptme-evals-anunsfxb/hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
