<thinking>          <thinking>
1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file to add user input
2. I can use the patch tool since we have the original content
3. The change is small and straightforward - replacing the print statement with input and formatted output

I've modified hello.py to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string
3. Used the exact format you requested with 'Hello, <name>!'

You can now run the script and it will ask for your name before printing the greeting.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
