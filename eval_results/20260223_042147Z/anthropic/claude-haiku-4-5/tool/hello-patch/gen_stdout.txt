The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. The patch should replace "Hello, world!" with "Hello, human!".

Let me create the patch:
- ORIGINAL: print("Hello, world!")
- UPDATED: print("Hello, human!")
</think>        </think>


@patch(toolu_01XRNjSrRBBvouchM8P4dXGc): {"path": "hello.py", "patch": "<<<<<<< ORIGINAL\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n=======\nprint(\"Hello, human!\")\n>>>>>>> UPDATED"}                                                                                System: ✅ Patch successfully applied to
