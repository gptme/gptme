User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it

The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

Let me do this step by step. First, I should check the current directory, then:
1. Initialize git
2. Create main.py with some basic content
3. Configure git user if needed
4. Add and commit the file

I can do the first two steps in parallel, then commit.
