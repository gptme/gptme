User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". I should use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the required content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been successfully saved. The user's task is complete. I should confirm this and let them know they can now run the script if they want.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created and will print "Hello, world!" when you run it.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
