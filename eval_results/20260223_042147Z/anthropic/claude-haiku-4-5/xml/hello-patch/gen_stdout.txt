Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I need to use the patch tool to change the string in the print statement.

I'll use the patch tool with the ORIGINAL/UPDATED format to make this change.

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
