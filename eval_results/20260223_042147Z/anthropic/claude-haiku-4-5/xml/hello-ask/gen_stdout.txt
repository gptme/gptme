The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting. Currently it just prints "Hello, world!".

I should use the patch tool to modify this file. The change is simple - replace the print statement with code that asks for input and uses that input in the greeting.

Let me create a patch that:
1. Takes input from the user asking for their name
2. Prints a greeting with that name
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

The patch was successfully applied. The user's hello.py file has been modified to ask for their name and print a personalized greeting. The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've updated `hello.py` to ask the user for their name and greet them with it.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
