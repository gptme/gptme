User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Initialize a git repository
2. Write a main.py file
3. Commit it

I can do the git init and write the file in parallel, then commit after both are done.
</think>        </think>

I'll initialize the git repo and write `main.py` in parallel, then commit.
