To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", I'll create a patch for you. 

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

It seems there was an issue with applying the patch because the file path was incorrect. Let me first check the current working directory to ensure I use the correct path for the file.                                                                                [04:20:33] Session: $0.01 | 1 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
