User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script that efficiently computes and prints the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
To solve this, I'll:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run
</thinking>           </thinking>

    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

                return current_num

Let's verify the script works correctly by running it:

<tool-use>
<shell>
python prime.py
</shell>
</tool-use>

python prime.py                                                                 

541
System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Great! The script successfully found the 100th prime number, which is 541. 

Let me break down how the script works:
1. `is_prime()` efficiently checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number
2. `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it finds the nth prime
3. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures the prime finding logic runs when the script is executed directly

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
