Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>          <thinking>
This is a simple modification to change the text being printed. I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
The file is in the current directory and contains a single line.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

System: âœ… Patch successfully applied to `hello.py`

The patch has been applied successfully. The code now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
