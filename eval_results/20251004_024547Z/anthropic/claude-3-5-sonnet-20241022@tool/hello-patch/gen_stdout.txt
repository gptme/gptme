Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The file content is simple, and I can see both the original and desired text clearly.

I see the patch failed because the file doesn't exist at the specified path. Let me try with just the relative path since that's how the file was presented in the request.
