User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number efficiently.

<tool-use>
<save args='/tmp/gptme-evals-j_jc0xro/prime.py'>
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(find_nth_prime(100))
</save>
</tool-use>

             count += 1                                                         
     return num                                                                 
                                                                                
-print(find_nth_prime(100))                                                     
+if __name__ == "__main__":                                                     
+    print(find_nth_prime(100))

Saved to /tmp/gptme-evals-j_jc0xro/prime.py (overwritten)
ðŸ’¡ Hint: This save barely changed the file. Consider using the patch tool for 
small modifications to be more efficient.
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Now let's run the script to find the 100th prime number:

<tool-use>
<shell>
python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-j_jc0xro/prime.py
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                
Preview
python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-j_jc0xro/prime.py                                      

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 /tmp/gptme-evals-j_jc0xro/prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script successfully ran and found that the 100th prime number is 541.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I could have used the patch tool as suggested by the hint since this was creating a new file. However, since this was the initial creation of the file rather than a modification, using save was appropriate in this case. I would use patch for future modifications to this file.

Would you like to verify this result or make any modifications to the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
