<thinking>          <thinking>
1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file
2. I can see the current content is a simple "Hello, world!" print statement
3. I'll use the patch tool to modify it to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting
4. The patch needs to replace the current print statement with input() and an f-string

I've modified the hello.py file to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Store it in a variable called 'name'
3. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string with the exact format requested: 'Hello, <name>!'                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
