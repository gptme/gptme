The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name instead of just printing a static message. I need to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print 'Hello, <name>!' with the name they provide

I'll use the patch tool to make this small modification.

The patch was successfully applied. The user asked me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. I've done that by:

1. Adding `name = input("What is your name? ")` to prompt the user
2. Changing the print statement to `print(f"Hello, {name}!")` to include the user's name

The modification is complete and the system confirmed the patch was applied successfully.

Done! The script now prompts the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
