<thinking> To modify the existing `hello.py` file, I will use the `patch` tool to apply a small change. I will replace the existing print statement with a new one that asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting. </thinking>

Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file

<thinking> The patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This is likely because the file contents have changed since I last read them. To fix this, I will re-read the file contents and try again. </thinking>

<thinking> Now that I have the current file contents, I can try the patch again. This time, I will make sure to match the exact file contents. </thinking>

<thinking> The patch failed again. This time, I will try a different approach. Instead of using the `patch` tool, I will use the `save` tool to overwrite the entire file with the new contents. </thinking>
