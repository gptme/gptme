User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                                                                              Assistant: 
Sure, I can help with that. Let's create a Python script that computes and prints the 100th prime number. Here's how we can do it:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    nth_prime = 100
    prime = find_nth_prime(nth_prime)
    print(f"The {nth_prime}th prime number is: {prime}")
```

The script `prime.py` has been created. It defines two functions: `is_prime` to check if a number is prime, and `find_nth_prime` to find the nth prime number. When executed, it will compute and print the 100th prime number.

Would you like to run this script to see the result? If so, you can use the following command:

```shell
python prime.py
```

Would you like to modify the script in any way, or perhaps explore another programming task?                                                                                                                                              --- Finished generation ---
