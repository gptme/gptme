Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll help you patch the `hello.py` file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
@patch(toolu_0153JibK8SRnzEADyCqnXgvg): {"path": "hello.py", "patch": "<<<<<<< ORIGINAL\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n=======\nprint(\"Hello, human!\")\n>>>>>>> UPDATED"}

I've used the `patch` tool to modify the `hello.py` file. The change replaces the original "Hello, world!" string with "Hello, human!". The patch was applied successfully, so now when you run the script, it will print "Hello, human!".                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
