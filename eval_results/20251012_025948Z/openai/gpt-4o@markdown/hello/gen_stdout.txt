System: ❌ Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from saving the file in the `/app` directory. You can try running the following command in your terminal to create the file manually:

```bash
echo 'print("Hello, world!")' > /app/hello.py
```

If you need further assistance, please let me know!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
