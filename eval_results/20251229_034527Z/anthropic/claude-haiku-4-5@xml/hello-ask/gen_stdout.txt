The user wants me to modify the hello.py file to ask for the user's name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. I should use the patch tool to modify the file.

Currently the file has:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to ask for the user's name and then print a greeting with their name. Here's what I'll do:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

<tool-use>
<patch args='hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
