User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll create a simple prime number finder script that can efficiently find the 100th prime.

Let me think about the approach:
- I need a function to check if a number is prime
- I need to find the 100th prime number
- Print the result

I'll use a simple trial division method to check primality, which should be fast enough for finding the 100th prime.
