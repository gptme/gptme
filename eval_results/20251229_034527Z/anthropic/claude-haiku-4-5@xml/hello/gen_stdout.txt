User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the required content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been successfully saved. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The confirmation message shows it was saved to hello.py. I should acknowledge this is complete, and optionally offer to run it if they'd like to verify it works.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the script that prints "Hello, world!". You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
