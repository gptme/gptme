<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and then print a greeting with that name. I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

Current code:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

New code should:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print a greeting with that name

I'll use the patch tool to replace the single print statement with the new code.
