User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I just need to use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a hello.py script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed it was saved to hello.py. I should let the user know it's done and perhaps offer to run it if they'd like.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a simple print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like to test it.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
