Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The change is straightforward - just replacing the text within the print statement.

print("Hello, world!")
