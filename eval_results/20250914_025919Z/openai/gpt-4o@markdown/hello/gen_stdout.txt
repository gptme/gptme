System: ‚ùå Error during execution: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/app/hello.py'

It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from writing to the `/app` directory. You might need to adjust the permissions or choose a different directory where I can save the file. Alternatively, you can create the file manually with the following content:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

If you need further assistance, let me know!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
