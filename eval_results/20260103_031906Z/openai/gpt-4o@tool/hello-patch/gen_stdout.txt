It seems there was an issue with locating the file `hello.py`. Let's explore the directory to find the correct path for the file. Could you please provide the correct path or confirm if the file exists in the `/app` directory?                                                                                [03:18:32] Session: $0.02 | 3 turns | 1k context | 29% cached
