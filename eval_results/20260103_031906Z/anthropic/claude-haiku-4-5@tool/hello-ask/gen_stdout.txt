<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of just printing "Hello, world!".

I can use the patch tool to make this modification. I'll:
1. Get the user's name using input()
2. Print a greeting with their name

Let me create a patch that replaces the current print statement with code that asks for the name and prints a personalized greeting.
