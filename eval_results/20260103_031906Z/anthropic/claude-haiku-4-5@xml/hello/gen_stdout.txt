User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I should use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the appropriate print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user's request is complete. I should confirm this and offer to help with anything else they might want to do with the script (like running it, modifying it, etc.).
</think>        </think>

Done! The script has been created and saved to `/app/hello.py`. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:18:43] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 965 context | 0% cached
