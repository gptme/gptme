Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking> The patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be because the file contents have changed since I last read it, or because the patch was not correctly applied. To resolve this, I will re-read the file and try to apply the patch again. </thinking>

Let me re-read the file and try again. 

First, I will read the file to get its current contents.
<tool-use>
<read args='/tmp/gptme-evals-bp_v3fw8/hello.py'>
</read>
</tool-use>                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
