The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print it with a greeting. I need to use the patch tool to modify the file.

Currently it has:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to ask for the user's name and then print a greeting with that name.

Let me use the patch tool to make this change.

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>

The patch was successfully applied. The user's request has been completed. The hello.py file now asks for the user's name and prints a personalized greeting.

I could verify the change was made correctly by showing the file, but the user seems satisfied with the patch being applied. I'll just confirm the change was made.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've modified `hello.py` to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. The script will now prompt the user with "What is your name? " and then display "Hello, <name>!".                                                                                [03:45:57] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
