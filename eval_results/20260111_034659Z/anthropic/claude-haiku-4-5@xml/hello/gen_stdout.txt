User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the required content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been successfully saved. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed it was saved to hello.py. 

The task is complete. I could offer to run it to verify it works, but the user hasn't asked for that, so I'll keep my response brief and efficient.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like to test it.                                                                                [03:45:56] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
