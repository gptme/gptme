User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to:
1. Write a Python script called `prime.py` that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/execute the script

I'll create a simple prime number generator that finds the 100th prime number and prints it.

Let me write a script that:
- Defines a function to check if a number is prime
- Iterates through numbers until we find the 100th prime
- Prints the result

I'll save it to `prime.py` and then run it.
