Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple string replacement.

I'll use the patch tool with the conflict markers to make this change.

The file doesn't exist at the expected location. Let me check the current working directory and create the file first, or find where it should be. The error shows the working directory is different from what I expected. Let me first check the actual pwd and then create or locate the hello.py file.

Let me first check the current working directory and create the file:

Done! The file has been patched. The print statement now outputs "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".                                                                                [03:45:56] Session: $0.01 | 3 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
