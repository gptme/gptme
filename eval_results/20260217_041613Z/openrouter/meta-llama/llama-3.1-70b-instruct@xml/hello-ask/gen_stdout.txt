The patch has been successfully applied to the hello.py file. The file now contains the following code:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

This code will prompt the user to enter their name and then print a personalized greeting.                                                                                [04:15:20] Session: $0.00 | 2 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
