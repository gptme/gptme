User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll write a simple Python script that finds prime numbers and identifies the 100th one.

Let me create a function to check if a number is prime, then iterate until we find the 100th prime.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="prime.py">
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
num = 2
while count < 100:
    if is_prime(num):
        count += 1
        if count == 100:
            print(f"The 100th prime number is: {num}")
            break
    num += 1
</save>
</tool-use>
                                                                                System: ✅ Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
Now I need to run the script to show the output.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<shell>
python prime.py
</shell>
</tool-use>
                                                                                The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

`The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
Perfect! The script worked as expected. The 100th prime number is 541. The task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script computes and prints the 100th prime number: **541**                                                                                [04:15:17] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 2k context | 0% cached
