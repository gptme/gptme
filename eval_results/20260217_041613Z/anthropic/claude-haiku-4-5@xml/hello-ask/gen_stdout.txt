The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. I need to use the patch tool to update the file.

Current content:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

New content should:
1. Ask the user for their name
2. Print "Hello, <name>!"

I'll use the patch tool to replace the print statement with code that gets the user's input and prints a personalized greeting.

<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
