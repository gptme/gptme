Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a straightforward task.

I need to use the patch tool to make this change. The file currently has:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

And should be changed to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

This is a simple string replacement.

Great! The patch was successfully applied to the file. The user's request has been completed - the hello.py file now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

The system confirmed the patch was applied successfully to the workspace. I should acknowledge this completion.

Done! The code has been patched to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".                                                                                [04:15:13] Session: $0.00 | 2 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
