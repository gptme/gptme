The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". I'll use the save tool to create the file.

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

The file has been saved successfully. The user can now run it if they want. I should confirm the task is complete.

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a script that prints "Hello, world!". You can run it with:

```bash
python hello.py
```                                                                                [04:15:14] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 952 context | 0% cached
