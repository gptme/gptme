User: 
Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to change the print statement from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple string replacement.

I need to use the patch tool with:
- path: hello.py (or the full path if needed)
- patch: a git conflict marker format showing the original and updated lines

Since I'm in /tmp/gptme-evals-qk7y2yin, I should use the absolute path /tmp/gptme-evals-qk7y2yin/hello.py

It seems the file doesn't exist in the path I tried. The working directory is actually `/home/appuser/.local/share/gptme/logs/2025-12-16-gptme-evals-anthropic--claude-haiku-4-5-tool-32486/workspace`, not `/tmp/gptme-evals-qk7y2yin`. Let me try with the correct path.
