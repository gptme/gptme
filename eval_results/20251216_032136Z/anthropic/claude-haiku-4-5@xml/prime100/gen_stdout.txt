User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call it to run the script

Let me create a simple prime number finder script. I'll use a straightforward approach to find prime numbers until we reach the 100th one.

I should:
1. Create the prime.py file with a function/code to find the 100th prime
2. Run it to show the output

A simple approach is to check each number for primality and count until we reach 100 primes.
