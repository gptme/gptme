<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. I can see the current content of hello.py is just `print("Hello, world!")`. I need to use the patch tool to modify this file to:
1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print "Hello, <name>!" using the provided name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.
