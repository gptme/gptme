User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I need to use the save tool to create a file called hello.py with a print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: âœ… Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user asked me to write a script hello.py that prints "Hello, world!" and I successfully created it using the save tool. The system confirmed it was saved. The task is complete. Since this is interactive mode, I should acknowledge the completion but keep it brief since the user mentioned not to explain basic concepts.
</think>        </think>

Perfect! I've created the hello.py script that prints "Hello, world!". The file has been saved successfully.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
