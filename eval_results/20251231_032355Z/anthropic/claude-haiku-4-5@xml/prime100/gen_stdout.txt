User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The user wants me to write a Python script that:
1. Computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call the script to execute it

I'll write a simple but efficient prime number finder. I can use a basic sieve or simple trial division approach. Let me create the script and then execute it.

I'll use a simple approach with trial division to find primes, which should be efficient enough for finding the 100th prime.
