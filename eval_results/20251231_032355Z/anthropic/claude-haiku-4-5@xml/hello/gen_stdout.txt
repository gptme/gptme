User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"

The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the appropriate print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. Since the user seems to prefer concise responses and doesn't want basic concepts explained, I should keep my response brief and just confirm what was done.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with the print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                [03:23:24] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 965 context | 0% cached
