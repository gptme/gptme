Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I need to use the patch tool to change the string from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!".
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
