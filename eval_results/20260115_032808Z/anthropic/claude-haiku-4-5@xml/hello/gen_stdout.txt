The user wants me to write a simple script that prints "Hello, world!". I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py

The file has been saved successfully. I should confirm this to the user and maybe offer to run it if they'd like. Since they're a curious programmer, they might want to see it in action.

Done! Created `hello.py` with the script. You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like to test it.                                                                                [03:27:14] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 954 context | 0% cached
