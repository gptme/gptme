Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll apply a patch to the file. 

Here's the patch:

<tool-use>
<patch args="/app/hello.py">
<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Invalid patch: invalid patch, no `<<<<<<< 
ORIGINAL`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems there was an issue with the patch format. Let me correct that and try again.

Here's the corrected patch:

<tool-use>
<patch args="/app/hello.py">
<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
</tool-use>                                                                                System: ❌ Error during execution: Invalid patch: invalid patch, no `<<<<<<< 
ORIGINAL`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
It seems there is a persistent issue with the patch format. Let me try a different approach by rewriting the entire file.

I'll update the content of `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" directly.

<tool-use>
<save file="/app/hello.py">
print("Hello, human!")
</save>
</tool-use>                                                                                [03:27:07] Session: $0.02 | 3 turns | 1k context | 0% cached
