The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. I can see the current content of hello.py is:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to modify it to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Print "Hello, <name>!" with their input

I'll use the patch tool to make this modification.

The patch was successfully applied. The user asked me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting, and I've done that. The file now contains:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

This will prompt the user for their name and then print "Hello, <name>!" with their input. The task is complete.

Done! I've modified hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. The script will now:
1. Prompt the user with "What is your name? "
2. Print "Hello, {name}!" with their input                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
