It seems that there is a permission issue preventing me from saving the file in the `/app` directory. You can try running the command with elevated permissions or change the directory permissions to allow writing. Alternatively, I can guide you on how to create the file manually. Would you like to proceed with any of these options?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
