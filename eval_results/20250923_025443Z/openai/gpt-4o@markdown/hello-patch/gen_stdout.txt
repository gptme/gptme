Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
To update the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!", I'll create a patch for you.

```patch
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

It seems that the file `hello.py` does not exist in the current directory. Let's first check the contents of the current directory to ensure the file is present. Could you please list the files in the directory? You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
ls /app
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
