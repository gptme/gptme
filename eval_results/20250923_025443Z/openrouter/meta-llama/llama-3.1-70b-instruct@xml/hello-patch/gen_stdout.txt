Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking> The patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be because the file contents have changed since I last read it, or because the patch was not correctly applied. Let me try again, but first, I'll make sure to read the current file contents. </thinking>

Let me read the current contents of the file `hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
