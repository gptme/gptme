To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, I'll update the script accordingly. Here's the patch:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Let's apply this change to the `hello.py` file.
@patch(call_WBIpkLfuOvGWTqldi4SRFECR): {"path":"/app/hello.py","patch":"<<<<<<< ORIGINAL\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n=======\nname = input(\"What is your name? \")\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n>>>>>>> UPDATED"}

It seems there was an issue with locating the `hello.py` file. Let's first check the current directory to ensure the file path is correct.

It appears that the `hello.py` file is not present in the `/app` directory. Could you please confirm the correct location of the `hello.py` file, or let me know if you would like me to create it for you?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
