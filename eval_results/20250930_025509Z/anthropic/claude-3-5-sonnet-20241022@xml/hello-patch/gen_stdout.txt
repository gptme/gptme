Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

I'll patch the file to change the greeting from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"
This is a simple one-line change.

Would you like me to run the code to verify the output?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
