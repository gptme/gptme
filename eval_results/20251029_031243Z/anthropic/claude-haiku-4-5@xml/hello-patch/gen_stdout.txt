Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to patch hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

I need to use the patch tool to modify the file. The current content is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

And it should be changed to:
```python
print("Hello, human!")
```

Let me apply this patch.
