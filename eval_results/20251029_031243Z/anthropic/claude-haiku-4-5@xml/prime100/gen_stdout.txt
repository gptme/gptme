User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call the script

I'll write a script that finds the 100th prime number. I can use a simple algorithm to check if a number is prime and count until we reach 100 primes.

Let me create the script and then run it.
