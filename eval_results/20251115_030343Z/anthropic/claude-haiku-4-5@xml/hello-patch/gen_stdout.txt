Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

The user wants me to patch hello.py to change the output from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!". This is a simple patch task.

I need to use the patch tool to change:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```
to:
```
print("Hello, human!")
```

This is straightforward.
