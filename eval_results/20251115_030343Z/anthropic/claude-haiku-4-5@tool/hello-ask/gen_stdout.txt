<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!' instead of the current hardcoded greeting.

I should use the patch tool to make this change. The current content is:
```
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
```
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Let me apply a patch to make this change.
