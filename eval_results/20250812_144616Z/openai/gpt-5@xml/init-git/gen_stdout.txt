User: initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I’ll set this up now.

First, let’s confirm the working directory and initialize a Git repo if needed, then create main.py and commit it. I’ll also set a local Git username/email if they’re not set, so the commit doesn’t fail.

Running the steps:
```shell
pwd
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null || git init
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
