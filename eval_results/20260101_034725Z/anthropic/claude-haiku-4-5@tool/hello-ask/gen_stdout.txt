<thinking>          <thinking>
The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name instead of just printing "Hello, world!". I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

The original code is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to change it to:
```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

I'll use the patch tool with conflict markers.
