User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"

The user wants me to create a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create the hello.py file with the print statement.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args="hello.py">
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: ✅ Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script that prints "Hello, world!" and I've done that. The system confirmed that the file was saved to hello.py. 

I should let the user know it's done. I could also offer to run it if they'd like, but since they didn't ask for that, I'll just confirm the task is complete.
</think>        </think>

Done! I've created `hello.py` with a simple print statement. You can run it with `python hello.py` if you'd like to test it.                                                                                [03:46:32] Session: $0.00 | 1 turns | 964 context | 0% cached
