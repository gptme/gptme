The user wants me to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a greeting with that name. I should use the patch tool to modify the existing file.

The current content is:
```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

I need to:
1. Ask the user for their name using input()
2. Print a greeting with their name

I'll use the patch tool to make this change.

<tool-use>
<patch args="hello.py">
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>
