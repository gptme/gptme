Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file to change the print statement to "Hello, human!"

Great! The patch was successfully applied. The code in hello.py now prints "Hello, human!" instead of the original "Hello, world!" message. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this file?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
