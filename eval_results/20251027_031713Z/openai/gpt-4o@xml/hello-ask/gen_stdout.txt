To modify the `hello.py` script to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting, we can use the `input` function to get the user's name and then format the output string. Let's apply this change. 

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
