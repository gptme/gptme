User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to:
1. Write a script called prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
2. Call/run the script

I'll write a simple script that finds prime numbers and outputs the 100th one.

I can use a straightforward approach:
- Check each number to see if it's prime
- Count primes until we reach 100
- Print the 100th prime

Let me write the script and then execute it.
