User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

The user wants me to write a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!". This is straightforward - I'll use the save tool to create a hello.py file with the appropriate content.
</think>        </think>

<tool-use>
<save args='hello.py'>
print("Hello, world!")
</save>
</tool-use>

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: âœ… Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<think>       <think>
The file has been saved successfully. The user asked me to write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!" and that's done. I should confirm it's created, or ask if they want to run it. Let me keep it brief and professional.
</think>        </think>

Done! The script `hello.py` has been created with the code to print "Hello, world!". You can run it with `python hello.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
