Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

The user wants me to patch the hello.py file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". This is a straightforward patch using the conflict markers format.

I need to:
1. Find the line that says `print("Hello, world!")`
2. Change it to `print("Hello, human!")`

Let me use the patch tool to make this change.
