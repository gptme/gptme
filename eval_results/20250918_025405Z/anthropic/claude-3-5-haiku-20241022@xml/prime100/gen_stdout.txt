User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called, then call it
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>          <thinking>
I'll break this down into steps:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Create a function to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result when the script is run

541
System: 
Ran command: `python /tmp/gptme-evals-0zh52c4a/prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script successfully found the 100th prime number, which is 541. 

Let me break down how the script works:
1. `is_prime(n)` checks if a given number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime(n)` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
3. The `main()` function calls `find_nth_prime(100)` to get the 100th prime number
4. When run, it prints 541, which is indeed the 100th prime number

Would you like me to explain the algorithm in more detail or demonstrate anything else with the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
