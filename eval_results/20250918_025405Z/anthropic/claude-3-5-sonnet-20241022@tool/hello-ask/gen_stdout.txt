I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting. 
The file exists and contains a simple print statement that we need to modify.

I've modified the file to:
1. Ask for the user's name using `input()`
2. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string
3. Used the exact format requested ('Hello, <name>!')

The program will now ask for input and greet the user personally.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
