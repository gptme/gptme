User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'

Let's modify the `hello.py` file to ask the user for their name and print a personalized greeting.

<tool-use>
<patch args='/tmp/gptme-evals-c7ezb8vk/hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
</patch>

System: ❌ 
Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems that the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be due to the fact that the file contents have changed since the patch was generated. Let me try again by reading the current file contents and generating a new patch.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<shell>
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-c7ezb8vk/hello.py
</shell>
</tool-use>                                                                                print("Hello, human!")System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat /tmp/gptme-evals-c7ezb8vk/hello.py`

`print("Hello, human!")`

Now that I have the current file contents, I can generate a new patch.

<tool-use>
<patch args='/tmp/gptme-evals-c7ezb8vk/hello.py'>
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, human!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
