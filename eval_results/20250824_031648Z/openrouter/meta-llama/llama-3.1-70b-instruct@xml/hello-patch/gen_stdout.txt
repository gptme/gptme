Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems like the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This could be because the file contents have changed since I last saw them, or because the patch was not correctly applied. To fix this, I will re-read the file and try to apply the patch again.</thinking>

Let me re-read the file and try to apply the patch again.

<tool-use>
<exec args='cat /tmp/gptme-evals-c3dd7gh6/hello.py'>
</tool-use>                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
