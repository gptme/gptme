<thinking>Let's use the patch tool to modify the existing hello.py file. We'll add a line to ask for the user's name and then print out a greeting with their name.</thinking>

System: ❌ 
Error during execution: Patch failed: original chunk not found in file
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking>It seems the patch failed because the original chunk was not found in the file. This might be because the file contents have changed since we last read it. Let's try reading the file again and then applying the patch.</thinking>

<tool-use>
<shell>
cat /tmp/gptme-evals-3v31c48i/hello.py

</tool-use>                                                                                print("Hello, human!")System:

<thinking>Now that we have the latest file contents, let's try applying the patch again. This time, we'll make sure to patch the correct original chunk.</thinking>
