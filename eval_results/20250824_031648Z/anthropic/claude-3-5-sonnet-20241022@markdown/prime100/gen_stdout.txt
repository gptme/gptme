User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number 
when called
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant:

Let's write a script to find the 100th prime number. We'll need:
1. A function to check if a number is prime
2. A way to count prime numbers until we reach the 100th one
3. Print the result
</thinking>           </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
    print(hundredth_prime)
```

Let's test the script to make sure it works correctly:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```
                                                                                
Preview
python3 prime.py                                                                

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

`541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script works correctly! It found that 541 is the 100th prime number. 

We can verify this is correct by checking against known prime number lists - 541 is indeed the 100th prime number.

The script is efficient enough for this task since:
1. It uses the square root optimization in the primality test
2. It only needs to find the first 100 primes, so performance isn't a major concern

Would you like to make any modifications to the script or would you like to test it with different numbers?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
