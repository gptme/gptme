Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

````hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
````

I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The file content is simple, and I can see both the original and desired text clearly.

I see the patch failed because the file doesn't exist at the path I assumed. Let me try with just the relative path since that's how it was shown in the example.
