# Web Browsing and Automation

Use browser capabilities to read web pages, search, and take screenshots.

## Available Functions

```python
# Read a webpage in text format
read_url(url: str) -> str

# Search for information
search(query: str, engine: Literal["google", "duckduckgo", "perplexity"]) -> str

# Take a screenshot of a webpage
screenshot_url(url: str, path: Optional[Path]) -> Path

# Read browser console logs
read_logs() -> str
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with search for unknown URLs**: Use `search()` to find relevant pages
2. **Read before extracting**: Use `read_url()` to see page content
3. **Check logs for errors**: Use `read_logs()` after reading complex pages
4. **Screenshot for visual verification**: Useful for checking layouts or UI

## Common Patterns

### Searching and Reading
```python
# Search for information
search("gptme documentation getting started")

# Read a specific page
read_url("https://gptme.org/docs/getting-started.html")
```

### Using Perplexity for Research
```python
# Get AI-powered answers with sources
search("latest developments in LLM agents", "perplexity")
```

### Taking Screenshots
```python
# Screenshot and view
screenshot_url("https://gptme.org")
```

### Debugging Web Pages
```python
# Read page
read_url("https://example.com")

# Check for JavaScript errors
read_logs()
```

## When to Use Browser vs Direct Tools

- Use **browser** for: Web research, documentation, public information
- Use **shell** for: Local files, git operations, system commands
- Use **ipython** for: Data processing, calculations, API calls
