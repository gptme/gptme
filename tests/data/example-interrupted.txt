## Roam Tasks Script - Context from Personal Notes

Today I created a powerful new tool to help understand the user's current TODO items and priorities from their Roam Research backup.

### Technical Implementation

**Created `scripts/roam-tasks.py`:**
- Parses Roam JSON export with full block structure and UIDs (23,300 blocks indexed)
- Extracts TODO items with complete context hierarchy
- Resolves block references recursively (up to depth 2)
- Multiple filtering options (by content, by page)
- Flexible sorting (by edited time, creation date, or page)
- Clean, LLM-consumable output format

**Key Features:**
- **Parent Context**: Shows up to 5 levels of parent blocks to understand where TODO sits
- **Child Blocks**: Includes all sub-tasks and notes under the TODO
- **Block References**: Automatically resolves `((uid))` references and shows their content
- **Timestamps**: Shows creation and last edit time for priority assessment
- **Smart Filtering**: Regex-based content and page filtering

**Output Format:**
```
