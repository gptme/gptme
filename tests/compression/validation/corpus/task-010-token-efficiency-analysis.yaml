description: Analyze token efficiency of different compression ratios
prompt: |
  You are analyzing token efficiency across different compression ratios.

  Context: Need to understand relationship between sentence selection and token reduction.

  Your task:
  1. Test multiple compression ratios (0.1, 0.15, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7)
  2. Measure actual token reduction for each
  3. Analyze sentence length patterns
  4. Document findings and recommend optimal ratios

  Success criteria:
  - At least 5 ratios tested
  - Token reduction measured for each
  - Pattern analysis documented
  - Recommendations provided

context_files:
  - gptme/context_compression/

success_criteria:
  - Analysis document created
  - Contains data for 5+ ratios
  - Includes visualizations or tables
  - Clear recommendations
